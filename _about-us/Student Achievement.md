			<p><b>Akid’s Personal Statement</b></p>
			<p>In 2017, I faced the daunting challenge of being accustomed to a new school environment. Everything was different and I found the curriculum challenging. I grappled to keep up with my studies and I recalled not achieving stellar results for my assessments. I was only scraping a U for Mathematics and C, at best, for English. This challenge continued well into Secondary 2. I simply could not understand why I had such a tough time scoring in my studies when my classmates seemed to be cruising along fairly well. I almost wanted to give up after two years of sub-par results. But I knew I shouldn’t, because there were many people who had placed their hopes on me to excel. I could not disappoint my mother and brother. I also could not disappoint my teachers, who had painstakingly imparted their knowledge to me for two years.<br><br>So I didn’t give up. Instead, I devised a plan.<br><br>What I did was to reflect on my personal choices. Did I put in enough effort in class and pay attention to my teachers? Did I complete my assignments? Did I clarify my doubts? With a newfound confidence, I stepped into Secondary 3 with a game plan.<br><br>In my first year in upper secondary, I kept a goal in mind. It was a simple goal – I wanted to do well in everything that I set out to do. First, I sieved through my friends. It is said that you are the average of the seven people that you surround yourself with. I knew I had to be wise in choosing my social circle. If I wanted to do well, I needed to surround myself with people who would help me thrive. I also willed myself to pay attention in class and paid no mind to any distraction that came my way. Soon, I realized that if I listened, internalized and practised, I could actually complete the once-seemingly daunting Mathematics questions. So I kept on listening, internalizing and practising. Soon, I grew to enjoy the subject. To make matters more exciting, I would challenge my tablemate to see who would score a higher mark during tests. Even when he scored higher than I did, I did not sulk. Instead, I took the opportunity to learn from him.<br><br>It was also at this time that I began to grow hungry for more. I knew I could excel even beyond the walls of the classroom. I just needed to prove to my teachers that I could soar as a leader. But it was tough because as a student grappling with adapting to a new school environment, I admittedly got into some trouble. They weren’t severe, but enough to affect the impression that some teachers might have of me. I knew that posed a hurdle if I wanted to pursue a leadership role in my class and CCA.<br><br>Again, I refused to concede defeat. I just needed to prove that I am a changed person and I could handle the responsibilities of a leader.<br><br>To prove that I was committed to my CCA, I reported to soccer training sessions an hour early for every session. I would train on my own to hone my skills. I also took the liberty to ensure the discipline of my teammates and encouraged them to be on their best behaviour, both on and off the field. I was determined to lift the morale of the team whenever we were defeated, and I made sure to affirm the cooperation we displayed on the field whenever we won. It was indeed a challenge to manage my peers because we were of the same age. But I knew if I wanted to be a leader, I had to overcome my own apprehension and reservations.<br><br>And believe that I could do it.<br><br>Indeed, I could.</p>
