# **School History**

The school began in 1924 as Geylang Methodist Girls’ School when it was founded by Rev Lloyd Sullivan, together with Mrs Chia Han Kiat and Miss Walker, who were members of the Methodist Church.  With a pupil enrolment of 27 girls, lessons were conducted in the sanctuary of Geylang Chinese Methodist Church.

With God’s grace, we continued to expand, becoming a full school and in 1951 our first batch of pupils took the Cambridge Examination (equivalent of the GCE ‘O’ level Exam) three years later.

The school song was composed in 1975 by Ms MJ Gruber, with music arranged by Ms Susheela E Daniel, daughter of Mrs SA Daniel, the Principal then.

As pupil enrolment increased, with the support and financial assistance from the Methodist churches, we built our own premises, and split into two schools – primary and secondary.  In 1984, boys were admitted for the first time in the secondary school, giving rise to Geylang Methodist Secondary School. The school was then officially opened by Bishop Ho Chee Sin on 29 Aug.

The school was upgraded in 1998 and God continued to pour out His blessings.  In February the following year, the school went single session with 38 classes (1,500 pupils) and a staff strength of 69.

2007 marked another important milestone for our school.  Besides the change of name to reflect the oneness of the GM family of schools, it also marked the completion of our re-development project.

We celebrate our 95th anniversary in 2019.  We are grateful for the past 95 years of blessings and believe that God will continue to watch over His students for many more years to come as we welcome future generations of students.

      <p>Information has been distilled from different write-ups, yearbooks, websites and interviews.</p>

			<p>GCMC Church fronted the premises, and school facilities were added to the back of the Church. This image depicts the Parsonage after its rebuilding in 1973.</p>

			<p>Girls perform in the open area behind the Church. The classroom in the background is adjoined to GCMC Church. A simple shelter can be seen on the left for the girls to play in the shade or when it rained.<br><br>Our school was initially formed as an all-girls school in 1924, named Geylang Methodist Girls School (GMGS). It became co-ed in 1984 and renamed as the Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) (GMSS) that we are familiar with today.<br><br>The genesis of the school is synchronically linked with Geylang Chinese Methodist Church (GCMC), a pioneering church that was initially established as a Gospel House in Geylang in 1905. After a short stint in a shophouse, GCMC managed to acquire land and move into its new Sanctuary and Parsonage at the junction of Aljunied and Geylang Road in 1914. Resources were scarce, and the Church relied on the goodwill of its members and the community for funding.<br><br>At the time, children in the impoverished Geylang area lacked access to education, and those children who could go to school had to travel a great distance to schools in the city. As such, GCMC established an ad-hoc English School for girls and boys, which utilised the Parsonage as a school on weekdays, when it was not used for service on weekends. However, in 1916, the boys were taken in by the newly built Geylang Boys School at Lorong 23. Concurrently the Methodist Mission had become more organised, and a drive to realise a Methodist school in Geylang arose then.<br><br>Hence, the goal to start a Methodist School was set in motion. The District Superintendent, Rev. Lloyd Sullivan enlisted the help of Mrs Chai Han Kiat and Emma Walker, a Christian Missionary, to take charge of the school’s operation at its infancy.<br><br>These driven and big-hearted women went door to door to entreat girls to enrol in the school. Thus, in 1924, the first official class of GMGS girls was humbly formed – composed of 27 girls who attended school in their own clothes. Mrs Chai was the only teacher then.<br><br>As the school had little funds and no land nor infrastructure, the missionaries and pastors of GCMC provided supervision and support. In fact, the Parsonage was used as the first classroom, so at its inception, GMGS kicked off its first school year right in the church.</p>
			<p><hr></p>
				<p>•<b>   1927</b><br>The British government bought GCMC premises to build a post office, and GCMC – and effectively the school – then moved to where the Aljunied MRT is currently located. It was then that 4 new classrooms were built behind the Parsonage building, and the school could stop operating from inside the Church. By then, enrolment had increased, with 135 pupils in 1927 and over 200 pupils by 1930.</p>

		<p>•<b> 1931 – 1938</b><br><br>
Our Church was situated on an important site. In 1926, the Municipality of Singapore proposed to build a post office and widen the road at the spot where our Church stood. The officials offered thirty-three thousand dollars to the Official board of our Church to acquire the Church premises.<br><br>Our Church accepted the Government’s offer. The Official Board believed that by accepting it the people living in the area would benefit. On the other hand, the Church Official Board applied to the Municipality for another piece of land situated at the junction of Aljunied Road and Sims Avenue, i.e. our existing Church site. The land area was over forty thousand square feet. It was only about two hundred meters away from the old site. It cost thirteen thousand dollars. To mount such a huge project, a Church Building Committee was formed. The members of the Committee included Rev. Swee, Messrs. Ng Tian Poh, Koh Kim Hong, Seah Poh Tee, Song Chin Eng, Chan Hai Seng, Lim Soon Bee and Ho Koon Chor. The District Superintendent, Pastor, Officials of the Building Committee and all members of the Church worked with one accord to achieve the common target. The baby plant which was richly blessed by the grace of God grew into a big and strong tree. By 1927, on the new site, a church was built at a cost of $16,000, the Parsonage for $4,500 and the Girls’ School for $17,000. It is understood that the latter was built at the expense of the bell tower originally included in the Church plan. Thus, the entire project of construction of the Church was completed. Since then, the Church grew and the number of members gradually increased. By 1930, the Church was in a position to be financially independent and self-supporting. The Body of Jesus Christ grew in Geylang as the days passed by.<br><br>In Singapore and Malaysia, our Church could claim to be the first to conduct services in three different languages for three different groups of congregation within a church.<br><br>In 1934, the school built a sheltered playground and the school servant’s quarters with wire fencing all around the area. Due to the increase in students, the School was found to be short of classrooms. Mr. Peh Hua Kok and a few others raised some funds and eventually, three extra classrooms were added. The Chinese Primary School was started in the afternoon and Miss Ruth Lim Soh Lian was appointed the first Principal. Miss Lim dedicated her life to the Lord and devoted herself to the cause of education throughout the long period of over thirty years. The administration of both the School and the Sunday School improved. In 1939, she purchased a piece of land with a bungalow on it, adjoining the school and Lorong 25. By then a Chinese kindergarten was also set up.<br><br>In 1930 the school enrolment increased to 300 girls. For many years it remained a primary school and pupils wanting an education beyond primary level had to go to Methodist Girls’ School at Mt. Sophia.</p>
