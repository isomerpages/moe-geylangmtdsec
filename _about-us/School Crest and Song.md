#### School Crest

<img src="/images/schlogo.png" style="width:150px;height:140px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right">

The School Crest is the embodiment of our aims and aspirations for the Geylang Methodist Schools. The Shield offers protection and reminds us of the Lord God who is our strength, our help and our shield.

Enshrined in the heart of the shield is a flaming torch formed by the letters ‘M’ and ‘S’. This symbolises the passion of GMS to seek the Light and Truth in Jesus Christ who is the Light of the World, and whose Truth will set us free.

The white 27-point starburst is inspired by our heritage when the school started with 27 pupils in 1924. This inspires us to continuously strive for pure brilliance and ingenuity grounded in our education.

The colours blue and gold frame our crest and represent heaven and earth respectively, reflecting our heavenly aspirations which are firmly grounded in our earthly realism to ‘Grow in Friendship, Body and Mind’.


#### School Song

In Geylang Methodist we strive  
To grow in friendship, body, mind  
And never fail to keep alive  
The Truths of God which guide mankind.

With grateful hearts we sing the praise,  
Of Geylang Methodist today  
And to her glory now we raise  
Our pledge of loyalty for aye  
When from each other we must part  
And cares of life around us press  
One thing will live within each heart  
The memory of G.M.S






#### School Motto

To grow in friendship, body and mind.



### Pupils' Creed

As Pupils of GMS(S),

**"To grow in Friendship, Body and mind"**  
We pledge to be God-fearing and true,  
giving regard to our parents  
and those in authority;  
respecting the rights of others  
and showing compassion to those in need.  
We vow to be honest, diligent and disciplined  
and with God's help,  
we strive to give our best  
for the betterment of ourselves,  
and our school and our country.
