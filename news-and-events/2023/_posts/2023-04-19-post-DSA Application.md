**INTRODUCTION**

Primary 6 students may seek Direct School Admission into Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) before the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise in 2023, for year of study in 2024.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1 to 4/5.

If you are a motivated student who wants to stretch your potential and be part of a close-knit community committed to growth, we look forward to receiving your application and to welcome you into GMS(S):

(1) Badminton for boys and girls (Talent area: Sports and games)

Our badminton team has been placed among the top 8 schools over the years in the highly competitive East Zone Inter-school tournaments. With the training and guidance from our dedicated teachers and coaches, we strive to create a dynamic environment for our students to continually push their limits and develop physical as well as mental fortitude.

Shortlisted candidates will be assessed on their agility and ability to execute movement, clear and smash.

Our volleyball boys have performed well in the national school games, emerging top 4 in the East Zone since 2010. Our B division team came in 7th in the Nation in 2023 and our C division boys came in 2nd in the East Zone Volleyball Championships in 2022. We strive to nurture our players to be tenacious, gracious and respectful students.

Shortlisted candidates will be assessed on their athletic skills and agility.

The Chinese Dance group has consistently done well, winning the Certificate with Distinction in the 2019, 2021 and 2023 SYF competitions.
