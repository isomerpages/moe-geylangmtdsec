**DSA**

Primary 6 students may seek Direct School Admission into Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) before the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise in 2023, for year of study in 2024.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1 to 4/5.

If you are a motivated student who wants to stretch your potential and be part of a close-knit community committed to growth, we look forward to receiving your application and to welcome you into GMS(S).
