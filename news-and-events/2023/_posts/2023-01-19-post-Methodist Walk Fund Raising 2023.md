The school is trying to raise $100 000 through the Methodist Walk to build a Green Trail for the following purposes: 
The Green Trail will help students learn about Sustainability so that they can be better stewards of the Earth.  It will make the environment a living classroom for the Applied Learning Programme (ALP). The ALP is in “Environmental Science and Sustainable Living” and its emphasis is on helping students learn about Climate Change, Food Sustainability and Energy Sustainability.


Through the Green Trail, they also seek to improve the mental wellbeing of their staff and students by encouraging them to be active and spend time outdoors amongst the nature and greenery in the school.  The Green Trail will incorporate a Physical Fitness Corner. This corner will allow students to do activities like stretching and exercises in an outdoor setting with more greenery.

 
The Methodist Walk is a biennial fundraising activity organised by the Methodist Schools’ Foundation (MSF), on behalf of the Methodist schools in Singapore.

We hope that you will support us by making a donation.  On our part, we will walk at least 50 km as their contribution to this worthy cause,. This is part of the organiser’s pledge that staff and students from the Methodist Schools will walk a combined 1 million km.
