<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) [GMS(S)], we nurture Passionate
Learners, Courageous Leaders, and Caring Citizens. Guided by our mission
— <em>"With God's help, to be a beacon of light by connecting, nurturing, and inspiring GEMS to make a difference"</em> —
we warmly invite Primary 6 students to seek Direct School Admission (DSA),
before the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise in 2025, for the 2026 academic
year.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to select schools wisely, considering
the student’s aptitudes, strengths, and the school’s academic and non-academic
offerings. Students admitted through DSA are expected to honour their commitment
by participating actively in their chosen talent areas throughout their
secondary school years (Sec 1–4/5).</p>

<p>If you are a motivated student who wants to stretch your potential and
be part of a close-knit community committed to growth, we look forward
to have you join us here in the GMS(S) family:</p>
