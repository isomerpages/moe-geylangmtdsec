<h3><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary 6 students may seek Direct School Admission into Geylang Methodist
School (Secondary) before the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise in 2024, for
year of study in 2025.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school
via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate
in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year
1 to 4/5.</p>
<p>If you are a motivated student who wants to stretch your potential and
be part of a close-knit community committed to growth, we look forward
to receiving your application and to welcome you into GMS(S):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(1) Badminton for boys and girls (Talent area: Sports and games)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our badminton team has been placed among the top 8 schools over the years
in the highly competitive East Zone Inter-school tournaments. With the
guidance from our dedicated coach and teachers, we strive to create a dynamic
environment for our students to continually push limits and develop their
physical as well as mental fortitude.</p>

to execute movement, clear and smash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

emerging top 4 in the East Zone since 2010. Our B division team came in
7th in the Nation in 2023 and our C division boys came in 2nd in the East
Zone Volleyball Championships in 2022. We strive to nurture our players
to be tenacious, gracious and respectful students.</p>
<p>Shortlisted candidates will be assessed on their athletic skills and agility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>The Chinese Dance group has consistently done well, winning the Certificate

in the Chinese Dance group are confident, passionate, and committed.&nbsp;
They are exposed to various dance cultures and are disciplined and motivated
