**INTRODUCTION**

Primary 6 students may seek Direct School Admission into Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) before the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise in 2022, for year of study in 2023.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1 to 4/5.

If you are a motivated student who wants to stretch your potential and be part of a close-knit community committed to growth, we look forward to receiving your application and to welcome you into GMS(S):

(1) Badminton for boys and girls (Talent area: Sports and games)

Our badminton team has been placed amongst the Top 8 schools in the East Zone since 2016 and each year, we have been pushing our limits and inching closer to the top 4 spots. Our team spirit is strong and players are passionate and motivated to train hard.

Shortlisted candidates will be assessed on their agility and ability to execute movement, clear and smash.

(2) Volleyball for boys only (Talent area: Sports and games)

Our Volleyball boys have performed well in the national school games, emerging top 4 in the East Zone since 2010. The Volleyball team is tenacious, gracious and members enjoy a strong camaraderie among themselves.

Shortlisted candidates will be assessed on their athletic skills and agility.

(3) Chinese Dance for girls only (Talent area: Performing arts)

The Chinese Dance group has consistently done well, winning the Certificate with Distinction in the 2019 and 2021 SYF competitions. Students in the Chinese Dance group are confident, passionate and committed.  They are exposed to various dance cultures and are disciplined and motivated to do their best for every performance.

Shortlisted candidates will be assessed on their skills and agility.

This is GM’s Applied Learning Programme and adopts a contextualized approach, exploring Sustainability with unique programmes for Sec 1 to 3.
