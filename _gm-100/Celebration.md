This year, our school will be celebrating Geylang Methodist Schools’ 100th Anniversary (GM100) – a hundred years of God's faithfulness, grace, and blessings. It will be a year of reflection and thanksgiving, themed “Celebrating God’s goodness”.

As part of the GM100 celebrations, the school is organizing the GM100 Family Carnival on 2 March 2024, from 8am to 1pm.

The GM100 Family Carnival provides opportunities for our GEMS to serve the school and to bless the larger Geylang community. During the carnival, our GEMS will be involved in running some stalls and our Performing Arts groups will be performing in the Friendship Hall. We will be inviting residents from various Homes and Senior Activity Centers in the neighborhood to our carnival.

The GM100 Family Carnival is open to parents of our students and alumni. To participate in the carnival, you can purchase a Fun Pass at $10 each. Each pass entitles the pass-holder to 2 snacks, 1 drink, and access to 5 games. The funds collected from the Fun Pass sales will be used solely to offset the expenses incurred in organising this event.

You are warmly invited to join us for the carnival as there are many activities in which you can participate even without the need for the Fun Pass. In addition to the Shopping Alley with the garden store, thrift shop, and snacks stall, you can also have your pictures taken at the photo booth or watch the concert performance conducted by our Performing Arts Group.

Yours sincerely,

Mr Victor Owyong
