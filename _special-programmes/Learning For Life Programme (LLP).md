The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is an MOE initiative to help students learn beyond the classroom.

In GMS(S), we offer LLP in the area of Community and Youth Leadership. Our LLP aims to provide opportunities for the holistic development of students, and to nurture confident and compassionate leaders. This is done through our focus on community service (Values in Action programmes) and student leadership.

Taking a multi-pronged approach, students are progressively equipped with leadership, effective communication and critical inquiry skills through the various facets of their school experience.
