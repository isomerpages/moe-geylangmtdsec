<p><strong>STUDENT-INITIATED LEARNING 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SECONDARY 1 &amp; 2 STARS PROGRAMME</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Why Student-Initiated Learning?</strong>
</p>
<p>Student-Initiated Learning on HBL days will provide dedicated time and
space for students to explore their areas of interests by initiating learning
activities on their own. Students will dedicate about&nbsp;an hour&nbsp;to
discover, develop and deepen interests through self-directed learning and
exploration.</p>
<p><strong>What does</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Student-Initiated Learning look like in</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Geylang Methodist School (Secondary)?</strong>
</p>
<p>In Geylang Methodist School (Secondary), we named our Student-Initiated
Learning the&nbsp;STARS Programme.</p>
<p>Our Secondary 1 and 2 students will choose an interest in&nbsp;one area
of the STARS&nbsp;and embark on a journey of self-discovery and development.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>ports and Wellness (E.g. Exercise, Health, Mental Health,
Food)</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>echnology and Innovation (E.g. STEM, Coding, Robotics,
Game Design)</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>esthetics (E.g. Music, Arts, Dance, Drama, Design, Language,
Culinary)</p>
<p><strong>R</strong>eading and Writing (E.g. Books, Novels, Poems, Plays,
Educational Magazines, Journals)</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>ustainable Living (E.g. Care for Environment and Nature,
Recycling)</p>
<p>This is achieved through a structured process of discovering of interests
and career choices with MySkillsFuture, followed by opportunities for self-directed
exploration and learning to develop their areas of interests. Students
will end the year with the opportunity to attend one of the STARS modules
in the SHINE Like MADD programme, which is aligned to their area of interest.
This will help them deepen their learning with the trainers who are experts
in the various industries.</p>
