<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Theme: Sustainability – Promoting a Sustainable World.</p>
<p>Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) Applied Learning Programme in Science
(ALP) adopts a contextualized approach in its curriculum design, exploring
a common theme on sustainability with a unique programme for each level.
We also collaborate with the relevant industries to provide students with
opportunities to address real-world problems.</p>
<p>GMS(S) ALP adopts a blended approach where the Tier 1 ALP, conducted for
all lower secondary students, is infused into the science curriculum, one
hour per week for 10 weeks. Tier 2 ALP is targeted at Secondary 3 students,
who are interested and passionate in the subject, and wish to further pursue
sustainability at a higher level.</p>
<p><strong>What Students Learn</strong>
</p>
<p>Tier-1 programme exposes students to basic science principles and the
use of instrumentation as they embark on investigative experiments / fieldwork
and engage in a mini-project on Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Sec 1, and Urban
Agriculture in Sec 2.</p>
<p>Tier-2 programme further develops students’ interest, abilities and attitudes
towards STEM. The program provides a platform for the students to explore
and connect their scientific knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems
around them.</p>
<p><strong>What the ALP Aims to Do</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities for students to apply science and engineering concepts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage students to develop independent thinking, scientific curiosity
and scientific inquiry through project-based learning, which incorporates
21 CC; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promotes interest in STEM subjects through inquiry-based experimentation
under a Structured Experimentation Programme, which invites students to
explore an idea, pose a question and to subsequently solve a problem or
to test a hypothesis. This allows students to extend their learning beyond
the walls of a classroom.</p>
