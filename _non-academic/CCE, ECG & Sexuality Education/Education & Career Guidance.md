### **Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Fair**

The virtual ECG Fair was held on 26 June and 13 August 2020 for the Secondary 4 and 5 students. It is a one-stop opportunity for our graduating students to acquire a better understanding of the post-secondary education landscape. On top of that, the fair also aims to introduce them to some of the possible career options that they might be interested to pursue in the future.

The ECG Fair served as a convenient and accessible platform for our students to have a dialogue with staff from various post-secondary institutions and practitioners in the private industry. We believe that our students will be in a better position to make informed education and career choices after participating in this fair.
