### CCE (Character & Citizenship Education) Curriculum

“Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life. This gives meaning to our work, as educators, in moulding the future of our nation. To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE need to remain current and relevant. CCE 2021 has been developed with this in mind, to help our students navigate the realities of their time.” \[CCE Implementation Handbook, MOE 2020\]

More information will be provided when CCE 2021 is rolled out.
