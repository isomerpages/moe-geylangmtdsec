<p>Welcome to Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) Parents Support Group</p>
<p><strong>-The PSG</strong>
</p>
<p>GMS(S) Parents Support Group works in partnership with the school to support
both the students and the school’s activities. The PSG Executive Committee
(EXCO) was formed in 2002 to be a bridge between the school and all parents.</p>

<p>In the secondary school phase of our children’s education, as teenagers,
they will desire more independence, and may experience an impulse to prove
to their parents that they are growing up. This then means that we as parents,
will need to change how we connect with our children and manage our own
expectations.</p>
<p>We affectionately call ourselves the PSG, aka <strong>Proactive</strong>, <strong>Supportive</strong>,
and <strong>Gracious</strong> parents.</p>

<p>We <strong>proactively</strong> network among our fellow parents and avail
ourselves when volunteers are needed in various school activities; provide <strong>support</strong> in
many forms including our presence, time, and financial contribution; and <strong>graciously</strong> co-create
the school environment into a familial, conducive, and nurturing space
for our GEMs. These include the Student Welfare Project, helping out during
school activities such as the cross country run, organising talks and volunteering
in other activities. An annual activity that the PSG puts together is the
Blessing Project, for which parents come together to bless the graduating
cohorts as they are preparing for their national exams, to let them know
that they are supported and loved. Parents have lovingly joined us to bless
the Sec 4s and 5s, despite the fact that their children are not in the
graduating cohort, and yes. Even those whose children have long graduated
from GM! Do join us in the various ‘divisions’ as we labour in love for
the kids!</p>
<p>The PSG family consists of the Management Team, EXCO members and our PSG
members. Together with the parents who currently have children in GM, we
also have a large group of ex-EXCO members whom we affectionately call
the ‘Alumni’ whose children have graduated yet still continue to support
school activities. We are grateful for the friendship forged and all the
fond memories established through our journey of supporting our GEMS in
GMS(S).</p>
<p>Be a part of us! If you happen to be in school, you can take a look at
the PSG notice board located opposite the Multi Purpose Room (MPR) for
the various activities that the PSG is involved in. You can also reach
