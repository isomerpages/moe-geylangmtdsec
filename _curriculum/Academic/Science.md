The Lower Secondary Science syllabus is a continuation and further development of the Primary Science syllabus. It is also a bridge to, and a foundation for, the pursuit of scientific studies at upper secondary levels, where students get to choose which branch of Science (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) they would like to pursue at the end of Secondary 2.


### Curriculum

The curriculum aims to develop students who will become confident and competent in Science through engaging and exciting Science programmes. The four- or five-year secondary science curriculum involves:

*   Acquisition of knowledge through inquiry-based approach classroom activities, enrichment programmes and workshops;
*   Application of knowledge through science projects;
*   Developing skills and abilities through lab work and hands-on activities;
*   Experiential learning through science field trips and external competitions such as F1 in schools, Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Challenge, Ignite Skills Challenge and Science Buskers.

### Assessment

The modes of assessment include:

*   continual assessment (theory, practical tests and project work);
*   semestral assessment (mid-year exam and end-of-year exam).

To enjoy science, pupils are encouraged to:

*   be observant and inquisitive,
*   be inventive,
*   be creative,
*   be curious,
*   have an awareness of safety and
*   have an awareness of natural phenomena and science-related social issues.

Apart from the core curriculum mentioned above, all students will have the opportunity to participate in, and be enriched through our applied learning programme in Science (ALP).

### GEMS - APPLIED LEARNING PROGRAMME IN SCIENCE (ALP)

**Introduction**

Theme: Sustainability – Promoting a Sustainable World.

Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) Applied Learning Programme in Science (ALP) adopts a contextualized approach in its curriculum design, exploring a common theme on sustainability with a unique programme for each level. We also collaborate with the relevant industries to provide students with opportunities to address real-world problems.

GMS(S) ALP adopts a blended approach where the Tier 1 ALP, conducted for all lower secondary students, is infused into the science curriculum, one hour per week for 10 weeks. Tier 2 ALP is targeted at Secondary 3 students, who are interested and passionate in the subject, and wish to further pursue sustainability at a higher level.

**What Students Learn**

Tier-1 programme exposes students to basic science principles and the use of instrumentation as they embark on investigative experiments / fieldwork and engage in a mini-project on Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Sec 1, and Urban Agriculture in Sec 2.

Tier-2 programme further develops students’ interest, abilities and attitudes towards STEM. The program provides a platform for the students to explore and connect their scientific knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems around them.

**What the ALP Aims to Do**

*   Provide opportunities for students to apply science and engineering concepts;
*   Encourage students to develop independent thinking, scientific curiosity and scientific inquiry through project-based learning, which incorporates 21 CC; and
*   Promotes interest in STEM subjects through inquiry-based experimentation under a Structured Experimentation Programme, which invites students to explore an idea, pose a question and to subsequently solve a problem or to test a hypothesis. This allows students to extend their learning beyond the walls of a classroom.
