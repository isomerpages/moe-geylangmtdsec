The Lower Secondary Science syllabus is a continuation and further development of the Primary Science syllabus. It is also a bridge to, and a foundation for, the pursuit of scientific studies at upper secondary levels, where students get to choose which branch of Science (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) they would like to pursue at the end of Secondary 2.


### Curriculum

The curriculum aims to develop students who will become confident and competent in Science through engaging and exciting Science programmes. The four- or five-year secondary science curriculum involves:

*   Acquisition of knowledge through inquiry-based approach classroom activities, enrichment programmes and workshops;
*   Application of knowledge through science projects;
*   Developing skills and abilities through lab work and hands-on activities;
*   Experiential learning through science field trips and external competitions such as F1 in schools, Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Challenge, Ignite Skills Challenge and Science Buskers.

### Assessment

The modes of assessment include:

*   continual assessment (theory, practical tests and project work);
*   semestral assessment (mid-year exam and end-of-year exam).

To enjoy science, pupils are encouraged to:

*   be observant and inquisitive,
*   be inventive,
*   be creative,
*   be curious,
*   have an awareness of safety and
*   have an awareness of natural phenomena and science-related social issues.

Apart from the core curriculum mentioned above, all students will have the opportunity to participate in, and be enriched through our applied learning programme in Science (ALP).
