### MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES

**Aims:**

* To equip students with listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) in order to be effectively bilingual.
* To develop in students a lifelong interest in their MTL so that they can better understand and appreciate their cultural heritage.
* To make MTL a living language so that students will find it relevant to communicate proficiently in everyday life.
 

**Emphasis of the Department:**

The Mother Tongue Department strives to build a strong language foundation in our students and to imbue in them the right values in the course of mastering their MTL.

### 1. Pedagogical Approaches

Promoting independent learning by fostering the necessary skills for acquiring MTL proficiency through the use of different ICT platforms.

Our teachers focus on the use of SLS and iMTL to engage students in their learning. This is in line with the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) as these ICT platforms encourage students to be self-directed, and allow them to personalise their learning according to their needs and interests. Teachers also make use of a range of tools to customise and create meaningful learning experiences for students. With the support of various ICT platforms and tools, teachers design authentic language tasks and harness interactive features to enhance students’ oral, written and interpersonal skills.

Besides the use of ICT, the Mother Tongue Department adopts a wide range of pedagogical approaches to cater to our students’ learning needs. Teachers also use pair work, collaborative learning, debates, Making Learning Visible tools, differentiated instruction and other teaching strategies to enrich students’ learning experiences.

### 2\. Department Programmes

##### Reading Programme

One of the main highlights of the department’s enrichment programme for students is our Mother Tongue Reading Programme. Articles from newspapers and excerpts from novels are chosen for our students to read beyond their textbooks. Teachers firmly believe that extensive reading helps to foster language acquisition and strengthens one’s spoken and written skills.

##### Cultural Programmes and Activities

Every year, our students will also experience some form of cultural activities, whether in school or outside school. The department believes in supplementing the learning of MTL through the use of cultural activities whereby students not only get to experience but also appreciate our culture.

##### Learning Journeys & Field Trips

Every year, learning journeys or field trips are organised to enhance our students’ learning experiences through visits to heritage centres, museums and places of interest.  Such trips are planned to reinforce experiential and contextual learning. In these activities, students learn by making real world connections that contribute to their understanding of the world.


##### Inter-class and Inter-school Competitions

Mother Tongue department prepares our students to participate in various language competitions. Such competitions increase our students’ intrinsic motivation to learn their MTL and also strengthen their academic abilities. By participating in competitions, we develop and nurture their confidence and collaboration skills.

##### GEMS Challenge: Overseas Immersion Programme

This is Mother Tongue Department’s signature programme. It enables students to personally experience how fast developing countries are progressing. Students are also able to understand future societal development trends and to prepare themselves for the future. In this programme, students will visit some cultural sites and schools to participate in cultural activities in a different setting. Through this, students’ cultural awareness is enhanced. In 2018 and 2019, our school went to China where students interacted with Singaporeans residing there - students who were studying there and entrepreneurs with businesses in China. This programme helps to widen students’ perspectives beyond Singapore and prepare them to face challenges in the future.
