### MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES

**Aims:**

* To equip students with listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) in order to be effectively bilingual.
* To develop in students a lifelong interest in their MTL so that they can better understand and appreciate their cultural heritage.
* To make MTL a living language so that students will find it relevant to communicate proficiently in everyday life.
 

**Emphasis of the Department:**

The Mother Tongue Department strives to build a strong language foundation in our students and to imbue in them the right values in the course of mastering their MTL. Lessons are conducted in a conducive environment where students are engaged through interactive and enriching teaching and learning activities.

The use of contemporary issues in newspaper articles, ICT, group work and various forms of assessment form an integral part of our school-based curriculum. The key focus of our curriculum is to let our students enjoy their MTL and to be able to use it confidently and effectively in all situations.

Throughout the year, various language and cultural enrichment activities will be organised to promote greater appreciation of the different cultures and traditions.
