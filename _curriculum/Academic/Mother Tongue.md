<h4>MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES</h4>
<p><strong>Aims:</strong>

<p>To make the Mother Tongue languages ‘living’ languages and develop in
students a lifelong interest in their Mother Tongue language and culture.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Emphasis of the Department:</strong>
</p>

students in their mastering of Mother Tongue languages and inculcate in
them moral values, appreciating the cultures and traditions through interactive
teaching, enriching learning activities and conducive environment for the
learning and using of MT languages.</p>
<p>The use of contemporary issues in newspaper articles, ICT, group work

curriculum. The key focus of our curriculum is to let our students enjoy
their MTL and to be able to use it confidently and courageously in whatever
situations.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, various language and cultural enrichment activities
will be organised for &nbsp;students. These activities will promote greater
appreciation of the different cultures and the Mother Tongue Languages

<p>Promoting independent learning by fostering the necessary skills for acquiring
MTL proficiency through the use of different ICT platforms. Often, teachers
emphasize the use of SLS and iMTL to engage students in their learning.
This is in line with the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC)
as these ICT platforms encourage students to be self-directed, and allow
them to personalise their learning according to their needs and interests.
Teachers would also be able to make use of a range of tools to customise
and create meaningful learning experiences for students. With the support
of various ICT platforms and tools, teachers are able to design authentic
language tasks and harness interactive features, so as to enhance students’
Mother Tongue oral, written and interaction skills.</p>

<p>Besides the use of ICT, the Mother Tongue Department adopts a wide range
of pedagogical approaches to suit our students’ learning needs. Teachers
also use pair work, collaborative learning, debate, making learning visible,
differentiated instructions and other teaching strategies to enrich students’
learning experiences. For the past two years, due to covid, teachers have
also switched to zoom for teaching and other online platforms</p>
<h4>2. Department Programmes</h4>
<h5>Reading Programme</h5>

<p>One of the main highlights of the department enrichment for our students
is our reading programme. Fictions and newspapers are chosen for our students
to read beyond their textbooks. Teachers firmly believe that reading help
to sharpen one’s mind through stimulation of the brain and it also helps
in language acquisition and strengthens one’s writing skills.</p>
<h5>Cultural Programmes and Activities</h5>

<p>Every year our students would also experience some form of cultural activities,
whether in school or outside school. The department believes in supplementing
the learning of MTL through use of cultural activities whereby students
not only get to experience but also appreciate our cultures. In addition,
every year, the department will also organize a Xinyao concert for our
students. It is a platform whereby our students will get to learn the Chinese
Language in an interesting and lively manner, so as to enhance their reading
and writing abilities through the promotion of local Mandarin songs and
pop culture. It is also a platform to encourage and promote the composition
of Mandarin songs, discover a new generation of musically talented individuals,
cultivate a spirit of creativity and innovation, and ensure the continuity
of the local Xinyao music culture.</p>

<p>This is the Mother Tongue Department’s signature programme. It enables
students to personally experience the fast pace of progress in developing
countries. Students are also able to understand future societal development
trends and prepare themselves for the future. For this programme, students
will visit some cultural sites and schools and participate in cultural
activities in different setting so as to enhance their cultural awareness.
In 2018 and 2019, we went to China, and students interacted with Singapore
students who were studying in China and also with entrepreneurs who had
experience doing business in China. From this, students would be able to
widen their perspectives beyond Singapore and prepare themselves as they
understand the challenges that they will face in the future. During covid
years, the department still carries out this prgrammes online. Students
did research online about cities in China and they had a chance for a virtual
exchange with school in China.</p>
