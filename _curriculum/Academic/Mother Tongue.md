### MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES

**Aims:**

* To equip students with listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) in order to be effectively bilingual.
* To develop in students a lifelong interest in their MTL so that they can better understand and appreciate their cultural heritage.
* To make MTL a living language so that students will find it relevant to communicate proficiently in everyday life.
 

**Emphasis of the Department:**

The Mother Tongue Department strives to build a strong language foundation in our students and to imbue in them the right values in the course of mastering their MTL. Lessons are conducted in a conducive environment where students are engaged through interactive and enriching teaching and learning activities.

The use of contemporary issues in newspaper articles, ICT, group work and various forms of assessment form an integral part of our school-based curriculum. The key focus of our curriculum is to let our students enjoy their MTL and to be able to use it confidently and effectively in all situations.

Throughout the year, various language and cultural enrichment activities will be organised to promote greater appreciation of the different cultures and traditions.

### 1. Pedagogical Approaches

Promoting independent learning by fostering the necessary skills for acquiring MTL proficiency through the use of different ICT platforms.

Our teachers focus on the use of SLS and iMTL to engage students in their learning. This is in line with the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) as these ICT platforms encourage students to be self-directed, and allow them to personalise their learning according to their needs and interests. Teachers also make use of a range of tools to customise and create meaningful learning experiences for students. With the support of various ICT platforms and tools, teachers design authentic language tasks and harness interactive features to enhance students’ oral, written and interpersonal skills.

Besides the use of ICT, the Mother Tongue Department adopts a wide range of pedagogical approaches to cater to our students’ learning needs. Teachers also use pair work, collaborative learning, debates, Making Learning Visible tools, differentiated instruction and other teaching strategies to enrich students’ learning experiences.

One of the main highlights of the department’s enrichment programme for students is our Mother Tongue Reading Programme. Articles from newspapers and excerpts from novels are chosen for our students to read beyond their textbooks. Teachers firmly believe that extensive reading helps to foster language acquisition and strengthens one’s spoken and written skills.
