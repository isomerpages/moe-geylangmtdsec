Promoting independent learning by fostering the necessary skills for acquiring MTL proficiency through the use of different ICT platforms. Often, teachers emphasize the use of SLS and iMTL to engage students in their learning. This is in line with the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC) as these ICT platforms encourage students to be self-directed, and allow them to personalise their learning according to their needs and interests. Teachers would also be able to make use of a range of tools to customise and create meaningful learning experiences for students. With the support of various ICT platforms and tools, teachers are able to design authentic language tasks and harness interactive features, so as to enhance students’ Mother Tongue oral, written and interaction skills.

Besides the use of ICT, the Mother Tongue Department adopts a wide range of pedagogical approaches to suit our students’ learning needs. Teachers also use pair work, collaborative learning, debate, making learning visible, differentiated instructions and other teaching strategies to enrich students’ learning experiences. For the past two years, due to covid, teachers have also switched to zoom for teaching and other online platformsaching strategies to enrich students’ learning experiences.

One of the main highlights of the department enrichment for our students is our reading programme. Fictions and newspapers are chosen for our students to read beyond their textbooks. Teachers firmly believe that reading help to sharpen one’s mind through stimulation of the brain and it also helps in language acquisition and strengthens one’s writing skills.

##### Cultural Programmes and Activities

Every year our students would also experience some form of cultural activities, whether in school or outside school. The department believes in supplementing the learning of MTL through use of cultural activities whereby students not only get to experience but also appreciate our cultures. In addition, every year, the department will also organize a Xinyao concert for our students. It is a platform whereby our students will get to learn the Chinese Language in an interesting and lively manner, so as to enhance their reading and writing abilities through the promotion of local Mandarin songs and pop culture. It is also a platform to encourage and promote the composition of Mandarin songs, discover a new generation of musically talented individuals, cultivate a spirit of creativity and innovation, and ensure the continuity of the local Xinyao music culture.

This is the Mother Tongue Department’s signature programme. It enables students to personally experience the fast pace of progress in developing countries. Students are also able to understand future societal development trends and prepare themselves for the future. For this programme, students will visit some cultural sites and schools and participate in cultural activities in different setting so as to enhance their cultural awareness. In 2018 and 2019, we went to China, and students interacted with Singapore students who were studying in China and also with entrepreneurs who had experience doing business in China. From this, students would be able to widen their perspectives beyond Singapore and prepare themselves as they understand the challenges that they will face in the future. During covid years, the department still carries out this prgrammes online. Students did research online about cities in China and they had a chance for a virtual exchange with school in China.
