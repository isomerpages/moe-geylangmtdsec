<h4>Social Studies</h4>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students
at the Upper Secondary level. Together with either Geography (Elective),
History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly
known as Humanities.</p>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens
of tomorrow by helping them to understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore
and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human
experience. More importantly, we seek to develop our GEMS to become informed,
concerned and participative individuals, competent in decision-making with
an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world
they live in.</p>
<p>The Department’s approach is based on the Humanities Inquiry approach.
Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant
knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore and the world,
develop critical and reflective thinking, and suggest solutions to the
myriad of issues facing our society.</p>

<p><strong>Issue Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary 3 Issue Investigation (II) project is a critical part of
the Social Studies curriculum. It forms an important component of our GEMS
Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify and research on
societal needs in Singapore. Our GEMS also research and suggest ways to
mitigate these issues.</p>
<p>In 2024, the II theme was ‘Sustainability’. Students worked in groups
to research and gain appreciation of the perspectives of different stakeholders,
understand the measures taken, as well as the challenges and trade-offs
in managing these issues. They made recommendations and advocated for active
contributions towards the betterment of society.</p>
<p>To align to the Singapore Smart Nation vision, students were taught how
to create a website to feature their II research, data collection and suggestions
to appeal to their target audiences.</p>
<p>The following are screenshots and links to some artistically designed
II websites from the 2024 cohort.</p>

<p>To foster critical thinking and hone research and writing skills, the
Humanities Department offers the Model United Nations (MUN) enrichment
programme to selected Secondary 3 students. Through participating in various
MUNs, students gain a better understanding of global issues and insights
on the mechanisms of international relations. They also get to sharpen
their public speaking and debating skills during these academic simulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, our GEMS participated in the National Youth Environment Conference
(NYEC) organised by Nan Hua Secondary School from 17th to 19th April. The
conference saw our GEMS involved in deep discussion about current environmental
issues which have lasting impact. They also had the opportunity to work
and learn from students from other schools.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker Series Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Speaker Series programme is a series of talks organised by the Humanities
Department, where speakers from various segments of society are invited
to share with Secondary 3 students about different societal concerns in
Singapore. The goal of the Speaker Series programme is to help students
better understand and appreciate how the concepts and issues in the Upper
Secondary Social Studies syllabus relate to real life, the roles played
by the different stakeholders, and how individuals can contribute to society.</p>
<p>For the first session of the Speaker Series 2024 on 1<sup>st</sup> February,
we invited representatives from the <strong>Singapore Food Agency (SFA)</strong> to
share with the Secondary 3 students about Singapore’s efforts in ensuring
food security. This topic is aligned to our school’s ALP (Applied Learning
Programme) focus on sustainability. The speakers shared interesting information
about food security and measures taken by SFA to safeguard a diversified
and reliable food supply. Our students found the talk interesting and insightful.
This session was also held in hybrid mode via Zoom and we were joined by
students and teachers from Broadrick Secondary School, Gan Eng Seng Secondary
School and Sembawang Secondary School. It was a wonderful time of learning
together as a community!</p>
<p>For our second session held on 21<sup>st</sup> March, we welcomed the President
of <strong>Willing Hearts</strong> as our guest speaker. Mr Teh talked about
the operations of Willing Hearts, and how they served the beneficiaries
through the daily preparation of meals. He also shared with us on how students
can play a part in helping the beneficiaries by volunteering to prepare
meals for them, or to befriend them.&nbsp;</p>
