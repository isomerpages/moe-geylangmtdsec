**Vision:**

The GM Humanities Department seeks to nurture in our GEMs learning dispositions which will enable them to be passionate and lifelong&nbsp; learners, courageous and caring leaders, confident and active citizens in a globalised world.

**Approach: Use of Inquiry as Key pedagogy**

*   Inquiry is adopted as a key pedagogy in the Humanities Subjects\*.
*   Inquiry is rooted in a constructive approach which aims to enhance the quality and effectiveness of learning, promote student agency and help engage students with content and concepts in Humanities in a meaningful and authentic way.
*   It promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their learning through questioning, investing issues, examining different perspectives, gathering information, constructing explanation, and also offering possible solutions to address complex societal and real world issues.
*   It ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

### Geography
##### **LOWER SECONDARY GEOGRAPHY**

The Secondary 1 Geographical Investigation (GI) requires students to conduct one of the two investigations on:

*   adaptive features of tropical rainforest plants and vegetation. They gather primary data about the plant parts and do field sketching. Combined with secondary research on the plant parts, the students produce a group report and a poster on their findings and create online posters on their findings from secondary research and videos of the heritage trees in Botanic Gardens.
*   water quality of different water sources. It involves an experiential learning where the students conduct water-testing activities to investigate the water quality of various water sources such as Kallang River.

The Secondary 2 GI explores places that are special or elderly-friendly to the residents in their housing estate. The students learn to create good questionnaires and conduct surveys with residents to gather primary data. With secondary research using various online platforms, the students generate a mini-report and group-end product on their findings. Secondary 2 students presented their findings via an online platform.

Enrichment activities are organised to deepen the students’ understanding on public housing in Singapore. One such example is the Housing Development Board (HDB) Talk. Under the HDB Friends of the Heartlands programme, students can become HDB Ambassadors and reach out to residents. This gives the students the opportunities to relate the content and concepts learnt in the syllabus to the real-life situations.

##### **Upper Secondary Geography**

The Secondary 3 students participated in a virtual tour of Chinatown for their Tourism Geographical Investigation.&nbsp; Students gained a better understanding of how they can &nbsp;investigate, collect data, analyse and synthesize information to construct their own understanding of tourism in Singapore.

With the advent of technology and emphasis on 21st Century Competencies, learning has changed significantly in and out of the classroom. The students are well versed with the available technological platforms to learn independently and share their learning with their peers across topics in the syllabus.

In light of the global challenges of sustainability, students explored the topic on food resources. This included the research on the role of technology in resolving issues related to food production and its impact on man and the environment. Through this process, students discovered the variations in the capacities of countries in tackling food shortages.

#### Humanities Department Enrichment Programme




**2. GEMS Challenge – Model United Nations (MUN)**



#### Social Studies
**Overview**

Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students at the Upper Secondary level. Together with either Geography (Elective), History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly known as Humanities.

In GMS(S), the Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human experience. More importantly, we want to build up our GEMS and develop them to become concerned citizens who proactively extend their service beyond the school to the community for the betterment of society.

The Department’s approach is firmly based on the Critical Inquiry approach. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore and the world; develop critical and reflective thinking skills; and suggest solutions to the myriad of issues facing our society.

**Issue Investigation**

The Secondary 3 Issue Investigation (II) project is a critical part of the Social Studies curriculum. It forms an important component of our GEMS Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify and research on societal needs in Singapore. Our GEMS also research and suggest ways to mitigate these issues.

To align to the Singapore Smart Nation vision, students were taught how to create a website to feature their II research, data collection and suggestions to appeal to their target audiences.

The following are screenshots of some artistically designed II websites from the 2022 cohort.

1.  **Speaker Series’ Programme**

The Speaker Series’ programme is a series of talks organised by the GMS(S) Humanities Department, where speakers from various segments of society are invited to share with Secondary 3 students about different societal concerns in Singapore. The goal of the Speaker Series’ program is help students better understand and appreciate how the concepts and issues in the Upper Secondary Social Studies syllabus relate to real life, the roles played by the different stakeholders, and how individuals like themselves can play a part in contributing to society.

We had the privilege of having Ms Fatima from the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) to share the challenges faced by migrant workers in Singapore, and the various ways in which MWC support them. She also shared how students could make a difference by being more gracious to migrant workers..

We had the honour of inviting Mr Russ Neu, the CEO of Social Collider, an aggregator of resources for social enterprises in Singapore, to share with us about food security in Singapore. The students learned about the food security challenges faced by Singapore, and the measures taken to overcome such challenges, such as the 30 by 30 plan (which aims to build up Singapore's capacity to produce 30% of our food locally and sustainably by 2030).

**2.Internal Security Department (ISD) Mobile Exhibition**

Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) hosted the ISD mobile exhibition in July 2022 to help our students better understand terrorism: its impact on Singapore, as well as the measures we can take to protect our country from these threats.. As part of the Home Team (under Ministry of Home Affairs, MHA), the Internal Security Department (ISD) confronts and addresses Singapore’s security issues and threats to keep Singapore safe and sovereign. Over the years, ISD and its predecessor, Special Branch, have dealt with many threats to Singapore’s internal stability, security and sovereignty.

The exhibition also included a section on SG Secure which is a movement to build the resilience of our community and a call to action to everyone in our multi-racial, multi-religious society to come together to safeguard Singapore and our way of life. As part of national education efforts, this exhibition reminds students to always stay vigilant as harmony does not come easy.
