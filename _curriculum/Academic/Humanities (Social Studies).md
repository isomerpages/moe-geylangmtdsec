<h4>Social Studies</h4>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students
at the Upper Secondary level. Together with either Geography (Elective),
History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly
known as Humanities.</p>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens
of tomorrow by helping them to understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore
and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human
experience. More importantly, we seek to develop our GEMS to become informed,
concerned and participative individuals, competent in decision-making with
an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world
they live in.</p>
<p>The Department’s approach is based on the Humanities Inquiry approach.
Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant
knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore and the world,
develop critical and reflective thinking, and suggest solutions to the
myriad of issues facing our society.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Issue Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>The Secondary 3 Issue Investigation (II) project is a critical part of
the Social Studies curriculum. It forms an important component of our GEMS
Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify and research on
societal needs in Singapore. Our GEMS also research and suggest ways to
mitigate these issues.</p>
<p>In 2024, the II theme was ‘Sustainability’. Students worked in groups
to research and gain appreciation of the perspectives of different stakeholders,
understand the measures taken, as well as the challenges and trade-offs
in managing these issues. They made recommendations and advocated for active
contributions towards the betterment of society.</p>
<p>To align to the Singapore Smart Nation vision, students were taught how
to create a website to feature their II research, data collection and suggestions
to appeal to their target audiences.</p>
<p>The following are screenshots and links to some artistically designed
II websites from the 2024 cohort.</p>

<p>For this project, students carried out an investigation into the degree
of food wastage in Singapore, and proposed some strategies to mitigate
this problem.</p>

<h4>Humanities Department Enrichment Programme</h4>
<p><strong>2. GEMS Challenge – Model United Nations (MUN)</strong>
</p>
<p>To foster critical thinking and hone research and writing skills, the
Humanities Department offers the Model United Nations (MUN) enrichment
programme to selected Secondary 3 students. Through participating in various
MUNs, students gained a better understanding of global issues and insights
on the mechanisms of international relations. They also get to sharpen
their public speaking and debating skills during these academic simulations.</p>
<p>In 2023, our GEMS participated in the Singapore Model Cabinet (SMC) conference
and the Ngee Ann Secondary Model United Nations (NASMUN) conference.</p>
<p>The SMC was a simulation of the Singapore Cabinet where our GEMS took
on the role of Singapore’s policymakers and discussed how Singapore could
tackle various issues, given our constraints and differing needs. Our GEMS
gained a better understanding and appreciation for the United Nations through
NASMUN which simulated the workings of the United Nations.</p>
<p>During the NASMUN 2023, two of our GEMS - Helen Hu and Rainer Lim of J32
were awarded the Best Delegate of their respective committees. This award
was given to the most knowledgeable student representative who presented
the best ideas in their respective committees.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker Series Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Speaker Series programme is a series of talks organised by the Humanities
Department, where speakers from various segments of society are invited
to share with Secondary 3 students about different societal concerns in
Singapore. The goal of the Speaker Series program is to help students better
understand and appreciate how the concepts and issues in the Upper Secondary
Social Studies syllabus relate to real life, the roles played by the different
stakeholders, and how individuals can contribute to society.</p>
<p>For the first session of the Speaker Series 2023 on 8th February, we were
honored to have <strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling, Member of Parliament for MacPherson Constituency</strong>&nbsp;to
be our guest speaker. Ms Tin shared with our Secondary 3 GEMS about the
issues faced by Macpherson residents. She shared some examples of the measures
taken to serve the needs of the residents, her own experiences and how
individuals like our students could make a positive difference through
acts of kindness such as acknowledging others by smiling and keeping our
environment clean. She also shared about the various efforts taken to ensure
sustainability in the MacPherson constituency.</p>
<p>For our second session held on 23rd March, we welcomed representatives
of <strong>The Food Bank Singapore</strong> as our guest speakers. They shared
with our students about the less-privileged groups in Singapore who struggle
with food security and the many initiatives taken to help them, especially
during the Covid-19 pandemic. They also shared suggestions on how our GEMS
can play a part in ensuring food security in Singapore.</p>

<h4>GEMS Challenge</h4>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>
</p>
<p>The ASEAN Internationalisation Programme (AIP) aims to help students better
understand the impact and opportunities brought about by globalisation.</p>
<p><strong>Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Globalisation is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that is transforming&nbsp;the
world in profound ways. Thailand is no exception, as it has become increasingly
integrated into the global economy and culture.</p>
<p>This programme enables students to develop a deeper understanding of globalisation
and its impact on Thailand by learning independently about the culture
and economy of Thailand through research, readings, workshops, and interactions
with Thai students.</p>
<p><strong>Thai culture:</strong> Students learn about the different aspects
of Thai culture, such as its language, arts, and cuisine. They explore
the ways in which Thai culture has been influenced by other cultures around
the world.</p>
<p><strong>Thailand economy:</strong> They also learn about the Thai economy
including its major industries such as tourism. They explore the challenges
and opportunities that Thailand faces in the global economy.</p>
<p>Students will work in groups to research on various aspects of Thailand/Singapore
and they will share their findings with the Thai students virtually. This
helps the students to foster empathy, resilience and humility as they interact
with the Thai students and appreciate a world outside of Singapore.</p>
