**Vision:**

The GM Humanities Department seeks to nurture in our GEMs learning dispositions which will enable them to be passionate and lifelong&nbsp; learners, courageous and caring leaders, confident and active citizens in a globalised world.

**Approach: Use of Inquiry as Key pedagogy**

*   Inquiry is adopted as a key pedagogy in the Humanities Subjects\*.
*   Inquiry is rooted in a constructive approach which aims to enhance the quality and effectiveness of learning, promote student agency and help engage students with content and concepts in Humanities in a meaningful and authentic way.
*   It promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their learning through questioning, investing issues, examining different perspectives, gathering information, constructing explanation, and also offering possible solutions to address complex societal and real world issues.
*   It ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

#### Social Studies
**Overview**

Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students at the Upper Secondary level. Together with either Geography (Elective), History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly known as Humanities.

In GMS(S), the Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human experience. More importantly, we want to build up our GEMS and develop them to become concerned citizens who proactively extend their service beyond the school to the community for the betterment of society.

The Department’s approach is firmly based on the Critical Inquiry approach. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore and the world; develop critical and reflective thinking skills; and suggest solutions to the myriad of issues facing our society.

**Issue Investigation**

The Secondary 3 Issue Investigation (II) project is a critical part of the Social Studies curriculum. It forms an important component of our GEMS Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify and research on societal needs in Singapore. Our GEMS also research and suggest ways to mitigate these issues.

To align to the Singapore Smart Nation vision, students were taught how to create a website to feature their II research, data collection and suggestions to appeal to their target audiences.

The following are screenshots of some artistically designed II websites from the 2022 cohort.

1.  **Speaker Series’ Programme**

The Speaker Series’ programme is a series of talks organised by the GMS(S) Humanities Department, where speakers from various segments of society are invited to share with Secondary 3 students about different societal concerns in Singapore. The goal of the Speaker Series’ program is help students better understand and appreciate how the concepts and issues in the Upper Secondary Social Studies syllabus relate to real life, the roles played by the different stakeholders, and how individuals like themselves can play a part in contributing to society.

We had the privilege of having Ms Fatima from the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) to share the challenges faced by migrant workers in Singapore, and the various ways in which MWC support them. She also shared how students could make a difference by being more gracious to migrant workers..

We had the honour of inviting Mr Russ Neu, the CEO of Social Collider, an aggregator of resources for social enterprises in Singapore, to share with us about food security in Singapore. The students learned about the food security challenges faced by Singapore, and the measures taken to overcome such challenges, such as the 30 by 30 plan (which aims to build up Singapore's capacity to produce 30% of our food locally and sustainably by 2030).

**2.Internal Security Department (ISD) Mobile Exhibition**

Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) hosted the ISD mobile exhibition in July 2022 to help our students better understand terrorism: its impact on Singapore, as well as the measures we can take to protect our country from these threats.. As part of the Home Team (under Ministry of Home Affairs, MHA), the Internal Security Department (ISD) confronts and addresses Singapore’s security issues and threats to keep Singapore safe and sovereign. Over the years, ISD and its predecessor, Special Branch, have dealt with many threats to Singapore’s internal stability, security and sovereignty.

The exhibition also included a section on SG Secure which is a movement to build the resilience of our community and a call to action to everyone in our multi-racial, multi-religious society to come together to safeguard Singapore and our way of life. As part of national education efforts, this exhibition reminds students to always stay vigilant as harmony does not come easy.
