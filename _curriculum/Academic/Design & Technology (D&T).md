The Design and Technology (D&T) department aims to prepare students for the rapidly changing environment in the world by giving them opportunities to think and intervene creatively through the Design process. The curriculum is structured with the aim to develop in students the ability to contribute to society through knowledge and technology that are both innovative and intellectual.

Design appreciation exposes students to product awareness, product functions, aesthetics, design in society, and cultural and technological influences on design.

Through the design process, students learn and practise basic strategies and skills in research, analysis, ideation and development, evaluation and design communication.

Students will acquire basic making skills and related knowledge through the manipulation of resistance materials, simple modelling materials and basic technology; and the execution of appropriate techniques and processes in a workshop environment.

Through making, students also learn to use materials prudently and develop the habit of effective and efficient work processes in a safe manner.

The revised syllabus allows students to think and do, to visualise and concretise design solutions for real-world contexts. It involves the manipulation of non-verbal codes (e.g. sketches, diagrams and objects) in the material culture to translate between abstract requirements (e.g. intellectual engagement and appeals to children) and concrete objects; facilitating the constructive, solution-focused mindset in designing and making.

#### Secondary 1 Post-Exam Challenge

During the end-of-year post-examination period, the department holds a "Design Challenge" for the Secondary 1 cohort. The students apply what they have learnt from the topic ‘Structure’; they design and build a tower to a height as tall as possible, to withstand the weight of a ream of paper. To stretch their creativity and resourcefulness, students are only given a packet of ice-cream sticks and a roll of masking tape to build their tower.

#### Projects Exhibition @ Geylang East Public Library

To recognise our students’ talents and efforts and to celebrate their successes in D&T, the department has collaborated with the Geylang East Public Library to display our students’ prototypes.


#### Science & Technology Challenge @ NYP

This is the twelve year that we have taken part in the Nanyang Polytechnic Science and Technology Challenge. Our students get to apply what they have learnt in D&T lessons in the challenges they have signed up for. At the same time, they also learn new skills and knowledge while attending the workshop prior to the challenge. 

One of the most rewarding moments for our students was when their designs were recognised and awarded during the competition.


#### Collaboration with TP

The department collaborates with various polytechnics to provide our students with a different learning environment. This year, our students visited Temasek Polytechnic-School of Design. The students have learned how to create their own portfolios for the coming EAE or DPP and the importance of it during the interview. The school of design has shared what are the courses and the prospect of Design.


#### Industrial Visit

Apart from academic studies and polytechnic exposure, D&T students are also given the opportunity to discover how industries carry out design in the real world. Industrial visits provide students with an eye-opening experience; they learn how a local engineering company, HOPE Technik is committed to deliver innovative products and solutions, translating concepts into reality.
