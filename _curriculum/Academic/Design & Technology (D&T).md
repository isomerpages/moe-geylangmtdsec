<p>The Design and Technology (D&amp;T)&nbsp;department aims to prepare students
for the rapidly changing environment in the world by giving them opportunities
to think and intervene creatively through the Design process. The curriculum
is structured with the aim to develop in students the ability to contribute
to society through knowledge and technology that are both innovative and
intellectual.</p>
<p>Design appreciation exposes students to product awareness, product functions,
aesthetics, design in society, and cultural and technological influences
on design.</p>
<p>Through the design process, students learn and practise basic strategies
and skills in research, analysis, ideation and development, evaluation
and design communication.</p>
<p>Students will acquire basic making skills and related knowledge through
the manipulation of resistance materials, simple modelling materials and
basic technology; and the execution of appropriate techniques and processes
in a workshop environment.</p>
<p>Through making, students also learn to use materials prudently and develop
the habit of effective and efficient work processes in a safe manner.</p>
<p>The revised syllabus allows students to think and do, to visualise and
concretise design solutions for real-world contexts. It involves the manipulation
of non-verbal codes (e.g. sketches, diagrams and objects) in the material
culture to translate between abstract requirements (e.g. intellectual engagement
and appeals to children) and concrete objects; facilitating the constructive,
solution-focused mindset in designing and making.</p>

<p>The department program gives students the opportunity to showcase their
talents by participating in external competitions and holding exhibitions
at external venues. The department also gives students the opportunity
to learn outside of the classroom by collaborating with industrial and
higher education partners.</p>

<p>At the recent D&amp;T awards 2023, 28 projects from 15 schools were conferred
D&amp;T Awards 2023. Out of these 28 projects, two were contributed by
our Sec 3 D&amp;T students, namely, Amber Cheah; Ng Qian Yi; Sim Jia En.</p>

<p>To recognise our students’ talents and efforts and to celebrate their
successes in D&amp;T, the department has collaborated with the Geylang
East Public Library to display our students’ prototypes. The students received
their awards at MOE HQ and their works are exhibited.</p>
<h4>Collaboration with TP</h4>

<p>The department collaborates with various polytechnics to provide our students
with a different learning environment. This year, our students visited
Temasek Polytechnic-School of Design. The students have learned how to
create their own portfolios for the coming EAE or DPP and the importance
of it during the interview. The school of design has shared what are the
courses and the prospect of Design.</p>
<h4>Industrial Visit</h4>

</div>
<p>Apart from academic studies and polytechnic exposure, D&amp;T students
are also given the opportunity to discover how industries carry out design
in the real world. Industrial visits provide students with an eye-opening
experience; they learn how a local engineering company, HOPE Technik is
committed to deliver innovative products and solutions, translating concepts
into reality.</p>
