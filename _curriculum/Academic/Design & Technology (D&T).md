# **Design & Technology (D&T)**

![](/images/Aesthetics-Craft-N-Technology-1536x1097.jpg)

The Design and Technology (D&T) department aims to prepare students for the rapidly changing environment in the world by giving them opportunities to think and intervene creatively through the Design process. The curriculum is structured with the aim to develop in students the ability to contribute to society through knowledge and technology that are both innovative and intellectual.

Design appreciation exposes students to product awareness, product functions, aesthetics, design in society, and cultural and technological influences on design.

Through the design process, students learn and practise basic strategies and skills in research, analysis, ideation and development, evaluation and design communication.

Students will acquire basic making skills and related knowledge through the manipulation of resistance materials, simple modelling materials and basic technology; and the execution of appropriate techniques and processes in a workshop environment.

Through making, students also learn to use materials prudently and develop the habit of effective and efficient work processes in a safe manner.

The revised syllabus allows students to think and do, to visualise and concretise design solutions for real-world contexts. It involves the manipulation of non-verbal codes (e.g. sketches, diagrams and objects) in the material culture to translate between abstract requirements (e.g. intellectual engagement and appeals to children) and concrete objects; facilitating the constructive, solution-focused mindset in designing and making.

			<p>During the end-of-year post-examination period, the department holds a "Design Challenge" for the Secondary 1 cohort. The students apply what they have learnt from the topic ‘Structure’; they design and build a tower to a height as tall as possible, to withstand the weight of a ream of paper. To stretch their creativity and resourcefulness, students are only given a packet of ice-cream sticks and a roll of masking tape to build their tower.</p>

			<p>The 3D Design Challenge is one of the school’s GEMS Challenge offered to our Secondary 3 students. In this Challenge, students learn how to use CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software to design a product and are taught how to use Autodesk Inventor to design a solution from their identified needs. Students will experience the process of 3D printing as their completed designs will be printed using the 3D-printing technology.<br><br>The students also have the opportunity to visit the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where they will be exposed to the courses offered in the higher learning institute.</p>

			<p>This is the ninth year that we have taken part in the Nanyang Polytechnic Science and Technology Challenge. Our students get to apply what they have learnt in D&T lessons in the challenges they have signed up for. At the same time, they also learn new skills and knowledge while attending the workshop prior to the challenge.<br><br>One of the most rewarding moments for our students was when their designs were recognised and awarded during the competition.</p>
