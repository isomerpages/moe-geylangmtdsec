Mathematics and Principles of Accounts are subjects that help students develop numeracy and analytical skills as well as logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

In the Mathematics Department, teachers are committed to helping students gain confidence and competence in the subjects by deepening conceptual understanding and encouraging creative thinking. In addition to teacher-led lessons and activities, students will have the opportunity to participate in IT-infused lessons and collaborative group work. Our teachers draw the relevance of the subjects to real-life context in lessons, developing in our students a passion for Mathematics and Principles of Accounts.
