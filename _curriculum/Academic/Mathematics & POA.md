<p>Mathematics and Principles of Accounts are subjects that help students
develop numeracy and analytical skills as well as logical thinking and
problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>In the Mathematics Department, teachers are committed to helping students
gain confidence and competence in the subjects by deepening conceptual
understanding and encouraging creative thinking. In addition to teacher-led
lessons and activities, students will have the opportunity to participate
in IT-infused lessons and collaborative group work. Our teachers draw the
relevance of the subjects to real-life context in lessons, developing in
our students a passion for Mathematics and Principles of Accounts.</p>
<h5>Aim:</h5>
<p>To provide a vibrant, exciting and meaningful teaching and learning environment
where students’ potential in Mathematics and Principles of Accounts is
maximized and the staff’s sense of professional fulfillment is met.</p>
<h5>Programmes:</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mathematics Learning Support Programme (MLSP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Structured Remediation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two GEMS Challenges for Secondary 3</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GEMS Challenge 1: GEMS Entrepreneurship</strong>
</p>
<p>Our GEMs Entrepreneurship programme equips students with the knowledge
and skills to spark, build and manage their business ideas. Through this
programme, young GEMs entrepreneurs develop an entrepreneurial mindset,
generate the inspiration and creativity to think out of the box and identify
new opportunities for innovation. They receive step-by-step guidance on
what it takes to bring their business ideas alive and gain confidence in
communicating and presenting their business ideas. Furthermore, they apply
concepts learnt in various subjects through this journey of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><strong>GEMS Challenge 2: MathStudio</strong>
</p>
<p>The MathStudio Challenge allows students to develop their creativity and
analytical skills through the creation of Mathematics-related lesson videos.
Students are equipped with videography skills and exposed to different
multimedia software where they can apply to create good quality lesson
videos.</p>
<p>This challenge helps students to stretch their conceptual understanding
in numeracy by exploring the different domains (Numbers &amp; Algebra,
Geometry &amp; Measurement, Statistics &amp; Probability) and using the
platform of creating videos to capture and add-value to their learning.</p>
<p>The creation of the in-house lesson videos aims to transform the students
to be able to guide and support their peers in understanding the subject
better. This challenge also provides a platform for the students to continue
to connect with and inspire their peers to develop the passion for the
subject beyond the classroom.</p>
<p><em>These programmes are offered to specific groups of students according to learning needs and interests.</em>
