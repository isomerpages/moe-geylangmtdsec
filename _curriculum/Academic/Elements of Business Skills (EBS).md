<p>Through the study of EBS, students will also develop decision-making skills
and an enterprising mindset as they conduct research and evaluate information
to make reasoned recommendations for businesses to make improvements. As
students gain knowledge and exposure to trends and innovations in the Singapore
business landscape, they also become more aware of the opportunities and
challenges they may face in the future.</p>
