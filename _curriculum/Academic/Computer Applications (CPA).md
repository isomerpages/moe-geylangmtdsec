<p>Computer Applications (CPA) is a compulsory subject for all G1 students.
The Upper Secondary CPA curriculum spans 2 years leading to the National
Examinations at the end of Secondary 4. In 2027, CPA will be renamed as
G1 Computing with a new syllabus.</p>
<p>The Computer Applications syllabus aims to prepare our G1 students to
be technologically-adept citizens, and to function and contribute effectively
in an increasingly technologically driven world.</p>
<p>The syllabus emphasizes fundamental knowledge and skills, and includes
the appreciation and use of software application packages for word processing,
computer drawing and image editing, multimedia presentations and documents,
spreadsheet calculations and charts, game design, programming, and applications
on the Internet.</p>
<h4>Computer Applications (CPA) Curriculum</h4>
<p>Students taking CPA will learn problem-solving skills and understand basic
programming concepts and skills. Basic programming concepts and skills,
learnt through simple animation and game design, can eventually be applied
to solve problems in everyday context. This serves to better prepare students
for further studies in programming and media-related courses, as well as
for the work place and future learning.</p>
<p>There are six compulsory modules in the subject. These modules are:
<br>(1) Computer Fundamentals
<br>(2) Media Elements
<br>(3) Document Processing
<br>(4) Spreadsheets
<br>(5) Multimedia Communication
<br>(6) Media Computing.</p>
