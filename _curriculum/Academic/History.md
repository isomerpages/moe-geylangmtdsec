**LOWER SECONDARY HISTORY:**

**Secondary 1 students** were involved in the Historical Investigation (HI) project on the Contribution of Immigrants to Singapore from the 1800s â€“ 1940. Students examined historical sources and use inference skills to learn about the ways in which immigrants contributed to the development and growth of Singapore into a bustling city port. Through this project, students had the opportunity to learn and apply historical skills such as source-handling skills and gain deeper understanding and appreciation of the life and contributions of early migrants in Singapore.

To engage and support Secondary 1 students in their Historical Investigation (HI) project, a virtual learning journey to historical sites in Chinatown was organised by the school during the GEMs Learning Day. The virtual learning journey provided students with an opportunity to explore the historical sites, examine sources and gather data which they used to answer the HI question.
