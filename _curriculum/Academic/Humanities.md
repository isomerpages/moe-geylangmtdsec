**Humanities Inquiry-based Learning as Key Pedagogy**

At GMS(S), the Humanities Department takes the lead in adopting the Humanities Inquiry Approach. It refers to the common understanding of how inquiry-based learning can take place in the Humanities subjects of Geography, History, and Social Studies.

Inquiry is a purposeful act of seeking information or knowledge, activating prior knowledge, investigating significant questions, and constructing knowledge. As it promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their own learning, it ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students into passionate learners. It facilitates an engaged, deepened thinking process in the learner about the issues under study and what these issues mean to them. It also grows the learner into a self-reflective inquirer who thinks about his/her thinking. We want all our GEMS to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

    <div>
			<p><b>Social Studies</b><br>Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students in Upper Secondary. Together with either Geography (Elective), History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly known as Humanities.<br><br>In GMS(S), the Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. More importantly, we want to build up our GEMS and develop them to become concerned citizens who proactively extend their service outwards beyond the school to the community for the betterment of society.<br><br>The Department’s approach is firmly based on Critical Inquiry. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore; develop critical and reflective thinking skills; and develop solutions to the myriad of issues facing our society.</p>
			<p><b>Issue Investigation</b><br>The Sec 3 Issue Investigation (II) is a critical part of the curriculum. It forms an integral part of our GEMS Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify societal needs and the possible approaches to addressing them. Our GEMS have the choice of presenting their findings in the form of a poster, report, video or presentation, which form the base for their Values-in-Action project in Secondary 4.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/QgLE2RoijIM">Click Here</a> for a short clip</p>

			<p>This is the ninth year that we have taken part in the Nanyang Polytechnic Science and Technology Challenge. Our students get to apply what they have learnt in D&T lessons in the challenges they have signed up for. At the same time, they also learn new skills and knowledge while attending the workshop prior to the challenge.<br><br>One of the most rewarding moments for our students was when their designs were recognised and awarded during the competition.</p>
