**Humanities Inquiry-based Learning as Key Pedagogy**

At GMS(S), the Humanities Department takes the lead in adopting the Humanities Inquiry Approach. It refers to the common understanding of how inquiry-based learning can take place in the Humanities subjects of Geography, History, and Social Studies.

Inquiry is a purposeful act of seeking information or knowledge, activating prior knowledge, investigating significant questions, and constructing knowledge. As it promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their own learning, it ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students into passionate learners. It facilitates an engaged, deepened thinking process in the learner about the issues under study and what these issues mean to them. It also grows the learner into a self-reflective inquirer who thinks about his/her thinking. We want all our GEMS to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

    <div>
			<p><b>Social Studies</b><br>Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students in Upper Secondary. Together with either Geography (Elective), History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly known as Humanities.<br><br>In GMS(S), the Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. More importantly, we want to build up our GEMS and develop them to become concerned citizens who proactively extend their service outwards beyond the school to the community for the betterment of society.<br><br>The Department’s approach is firmly based on Critical Inquiry. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore; develop critical and reflective thinking skills; and develop solutions to the myriad of issues facing our society.</p>
			<p><b>Issue Investigation</b><br>The Sec 3 Issue Investigation (II) is a critical part of the curriculum. It forms an integral part of our GEMS Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify societal needs and the possible approaches to addressing them. Our GEMS have the choice of presenting their findings in the form of a poster, report, video or presentation, which form the base for their Values-in-Action project in Secondary 4.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/QgLE2RoijIM">Click Here</a> for a short clip</p>
			<p><b>Enrichment Programmes/Competition</b><br>Our Sec 3 students continue to take part in various Model United Nations (MUN) as part of their GEMS Challenge. Through MUN, students hone their research and writing skills as well as build their confidence in public speaking and debating.</p>

			<p><h3>Sec 1 Geography</h3><br>The Secondary 1 Geographical Investigation examines the adaptive features of tropical rainforest plants and vegetation. Secondary 1 students will embark on a field trip to the Botanic Gardens, facilitated by the Upper Secondary Geography students. They gather primary data about the plant parts and do field sketching. Combined with secondary research on the plant parts, the students produce a group report and a poster on their findings. The Secondary 1 GI follows the geographical inquiry process closely.<br><br>During the COVID-19 situation, the Secondary 1 students created online posters on their findings from secondary research and videos of the heritage trees in Botanic Gardens. To enhance experiential learning, the students conducted water-testing activities to investigate the water quality of various water sources such as Kallang River.<br><br><img src="/images/S1-G-students-1024x681.png">Sec 1 Geography students examine a tropical rainforest tree in Botanic Gardens</p>
				<p><h3>Sec 2 Geography</h3><br>The Secondary 2 Geographical Investigation explores the places that are special or elderly-friendly to the residents in their housing estate. The students learn to create good questionnaires and conduct surveys with residents to gather primary data. With secondary research, the students generate a mini-report and group-end product on their findings. The Secondary 2 GI follows closely the geographical inquiry process.<br><br>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 situation, the Secondary 2 students presented their findings via an online platform, using both secondary research and primary data collected from online interviews.<br><br>Every year, enrichment activities such as HDB Talk are organised to deepen the students’ knowledge on public housing in Singapore. Selected Secondary 2 students also participate in URA workshops to gain knowledge on urban planning. Under the HDB Friends of the Heartlands programme, students become HDB Ambassadors and reach out to residents who participate in various housing estates.<br><br><img src="/images/S2-G-students.png">HDB Youth Ambassadors interview residents in Pasir Ris estate</p>

			<p><h3>Sec 3 Geographical Investigation</h3><br>By carrying out the GI activities in school and in the community, Elective Geography students examine the fundamental concepts and essential principles involved in the Earth’s weather and climate system. They gain an understanding of the scientific basis of changing weather and climate and the complex interconnections among the physical and biological components of the Earth system. Through the study, students also appreciate that climate change poses challenges as well as opportunities.<img src="/images/A1-1024x576.jpg">By carrying out the GI activities in Chinatown, Core/Elective Geography students gain a better understanding of the challenges faced in the global competition for the tourist dollar and the management of tourist sites.<br><br>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 situation, the Secondary 3 students did a virtual Chinatown G.I. Students learnt how the growth in tourism had an impact on people and places and that careful management is required in order to ensure its sustainability.<img src="/images/Sec4-GI.jpg"></p>

			<p><b>Secondary 1 Historical Investigation</b><br>2020 was a special year for Secondary 1 Historical Investigation (HI project). Home-based learning and the digitalisation of learning saw teachers bringing the HI project to students’ homes, in place of the normal learning journeys that are required in HI. Students could easily access Little India, Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Beach Road through pictures in a Google Drive folder. While the key elements of working together, selecting evidence and formulating inferences remain, the end products were adjusted and well-designed and informative online posters were produced.</p>

			<p><b>Secondary 1 Healthcare</b><br>2020 was the year when Covid-19 hogged the headlines. To help students see the historical connection of present pandemic to past pandemics, students embarked on a healthcare project to find out the state of healthcare conditions in early 19th century Singapore. Students had to gather data about hospitals, medical facilities and public health measures. They had to study one infectious disease and analyse how it was brought under control.</p>

    <div>
			<p><b>Humanities Internationalisation Programme</b><br>This internationalisation trip aims to teach our student travellers an appreciation of the world outside Singapore as well as equip them with knowledge, understanding, and a chance to witness the process of globalisation first-hand. Students on this trip also learn the importance of Singapore’s collaboration with Vietnam and other members within the ASEAN community. Singapore’s partnership with Vietnam began in 2013 with a strong economic cooperation culminating in the formation of the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs).<br><br>The internationalisation trip also seeks to provide students with the opportunity to absorb the sights and sounds of modernisation as well as rural Vietnam; experience the lives of local Vietnamese by visiting organic farms, villages; and learn local culture and history by visiting the War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi tunnels and various other historical sites.<br><br>Through this, we hope to encourage our student travellers to respect the socio-economic and cultural differences and norms and become a global citizen ready for the 22nd century.<br><br>In 2020, the internationalisation trip was adapted into a virtual trip to Vietnam, due to restrictions as a result of Covid-19. In this virtual trip, students held Zoom sessions with local Vietnamese establishments, to learn the impact of Covid-19 on the people of Vietnam and their adaptability to socio-cultural changes. The focus was on the impact of Covid-19 on the Vietnamese economy, tourism as well as its impact on local student life and education.</p>
