**Humanities Inquiry-based Learning as Key Pedagogy**

At GMS(S), the Humanities Department takes the lead in adopting the Humanities Inquiry Approach. It refers to the common understanding of how inquiry-based learning can take place in the Humanities subjects of Geography, History, and Social Studies.

Inquiry is a purposeful act of seeking information or knowledge, activating prior knowledge, investigating significant questions, and constructing knowledge. As it promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their own learning, it ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students into passionate learners. It facilitates an engaged, deepened thinking process in the learner about the issues under study and what these issues mean to them. It also grows the learner into a self-reflective inquirer who thinks about his/her thinking. We want all our GEMS to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

    <div>
			<p><b>Social Studies</b><br>Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students in Upper Secondary. Together with either Geography (Elective), History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly known as Humanities.<br><br>In GMS(S), the Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to better understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. More importantly, we want to build up our GEMS and develop them to become concerned citizens who proactively extend their service outwards beyond the school to the community for the betterment of society.<br><br>The Department’s approach is firmly based on Critical Inquiry. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore; develop critical and reflective thinking skills; and develop solutions to the myriad of issues facing our society.</p>
			<p><b>Issue Investigation</b><br>The Sec 3 Issue Investigation (II) is a critical part of the curriculum. It forms an integral part of our GEMS Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify societal needs and the possible approaches to addressing them. Our GEMS have the choice of presenting their findings in the form of a poster, report, video or presentation, which form the base for their Values-in-Action project in Secondary 4.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/QgLE2RoijIM">Click Here</a> for a short clip</p>
			<p><b>Enrichment Programmes/Competition</b><br>Our Sec 3 students continue to take part in various Model United Nations (MUN) as part of their GEMS Challenge. Through MUN, students hone their research and writing skills as well as build their confidence in public speaking and debating.</p>

			<p><h3>Sec 1 Geography</h3><br>The Secondary 1 Geographical Investigation examines the adaptive features of tropical rainforest plants and vegetation. Secondary 1 students will embark on a field trip to the Botanic Gardens, facilitated by the Upper Secondary Geography students. They gather primary data about the plant parts and do field sketching. Combined with secondary research on the plant parts, the students produce a group report and a poster on their findings. The Secondary 1 GI follows the geographical inquiry process closely.<br><br>During the COVID-19 situation, the Secondary 1 students created online posters on their findings from secondary research and videos of the heritage trees in Botanic Gardens. To enhance experiential learning, the students conducted water-testing activities to investigate the water quality of various water sources such as Kallang River.<br><br><img src="/images/S1-G-students-1024x681.png">Sec 1 Geography students examine a tropical rainforest tree in Botanic Gardens</p>
				<p><h3>Sec 2 Geography</h3><br>The Secondary 2 Geographical Investigation explores the places that are special or elderly-friendly to the residents in their housing estate. The students learn to create good questionnaires and conduct surveys with residents to gather primary data. With secondary research, the students generate a mini-report and group-end product on their findings. The Secondary 2 GI follows closely the geographical inquiry process.<br><br>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 situation, the Secondary 2 students presented their findings via an online platform, using both secondary research and primary data collected from online interviews.<br><br>Every year, enrichment activities such as HDB Talk are organised to deepen the students’ knowledge on public housing in Singapore. Selected Secondary 2 students also participate in URA workshops to gain knowledge on urban planning. Under the HDB Friends of the Heartlands programme, students become HDB Ambassadors and reach out to residents who participate in various housing estates.<br><br><img src="/images/S2-G-students.png">HDB Youth Ambassadors interview residents in Pasir Ris estate</p>

			<p><h3>Sec 3 Geographical Investigation</h3><br>By carrying out the GI activities in school and in the community, Elective Geography students examine the fundamental concepts and essential principles involved in the Earth’s weather and climate system. They gain an understanding of the scientific basis of changing weather and climate and the complex interconnections among the physical and biological components of the Earth system. Through the study, students also appreciate that climate change poses challenges as well as opportunities.</p>
