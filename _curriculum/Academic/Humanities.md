**Vision:**

The GM Humanities Department seeks to nurture in our GEMs learning dispositions which will enable them to be passionate and lifelong&nbsp; learners, courageous and caring leaders, confident and active citizens in a globalised world.

**Approach: Use of Inquiry as Key pedagogy**

*   Inquiry is adopted as a key pedagogy in the Humanities Subjects\*.
*   Inquiry is rooted in a constructive approach which aims to enhance the quality and effectiveness of learning, promote student agency and help engage students with content and concepts in Humanities in a meaningful and authentic way.
*   It promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their learning through questioning, investing issues, examining different perspectives, gathering information, constructing explanation, and also offering possible solutions to address complex societal and real world issues.
*   It ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

### Geography
##### **LOWER SECONDARY GEOGRAPHY**

The Secondary 1 Geographical Investigation (GI) requires students to conduct one of the two investigations on:

*   adaptive features of tropical rainforest plants and vegetation. They gather primary data about the plant parts and do field sketching. Combined with secondary research on the plant parts, the students produce a group report and a poster on their findings and create online posters on their findings from secondary research and videos of the heritage trees in Botanic Gardens.
*   water quality of different water sources. It involves an experiential learning where the students conduct water-testing activities to investigate the water quality of various water sources such as Kallang River.

The Secondary 2 GI explores places that are special or elderly-friendly to the residents in their housing estate. The students learn to create good questionnaires and conduct surveys with residents to gather primary data. With secondary research using various online platforms, the students generate a mini-report and group-end product on their findings. Secondary 2 students presented their findings via an online platform.

Enrichment activities are organised to deepen the students’ understanding on public housing in Singapore. One such example is the Housing Development Board (HDB) Talk. Under the HDB Friends of the Heartlands programme, students can become HDB Ambassadors and reach out to residents. This gives the students the opportunities to relate the content and concepts learnt in the syllabus to the real-life situations.

With the advent of technology and emphasis on 21st Century Competencies, learning has changed significantly in and out of the classroom. The students are well versed with the available technological platforms to learn independently and share their learning with their peers across topics in the syllabus.

In light of the global challenges of sustainability, students explored the topic on food resources. This included the research on the role of technology in resolving issues related to food production and its impact on man and the environment. Through this process, students discovered the variations in the capacities of countries in tackling food shortages.

#### History
**History Curriculum**

History education in Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) seeks to develop in students an appreciation of past human experiences, critical awareness of the nature of historical knowledge, and the ability to make connections between the past and present. In a world where attention is often divided between concerns over the present and the future, the relevance of History is often questioned. Learning to manage the present and anticipate the future would not be possible without knowing the past.

History equips students with knowledge and skills that enable them to draw connections between the past and present by understanding how the nature and impact of past developments explain today’s world. Students will gain a better understanding of why things happened in the past and how past events shape the present, and thus be better able to anticipate what might take place in the future. They will develop a disciplined and critical mind and an ability to operate in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world.

History also plays a critical role in developing students’ identities through an understanding of the subject at the personal, national and international levels. The learning of history should spark their curiosity and help them empathise with the beliefs, decisions and dilemmas of people in the past. Through historical inquiry, students pose questions about the past and the present and draw connections between the two.

Students are also given the opportunity to learn more about History and its relevance to present day through a variety of experiences and activities such as watching the LKY Musical, participating in virtual learning Journey, visit to the museums, amongst others. Students who are interested in the subject will also have opportunities to extend their interest through a series of talent development programmes such as participation in the MOE History challenge, Model United Nation models, amongst others.

**1. NE Cum Art Appreciation Programme - The LKY Musical 2022**

As part of the National Education (NE) cum Art Appreciation Programme, the Secondary 2 students were given the opportunity to watch 'The LKY Musical', a home-grown musical which tells the story of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, from his student days in 1941 to the struggles leading to Singapore's independence in 1965.

Through this experience, it is hoped that our students will develop a greater sense of appreciation and understanding of the role played by Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the early leaders in the development and growth of Singapore, and at the same time, gain an appreciation of the creative processes involved in a musical. The viewing of this musical is also part of National Education programme, to foster a sense of belonging amongst our students and an emotional rootedness to Singapore.

**2. National Heritage Board: Founder’s Memorial Exhibition**

The National Heritage Board (NHB) has organised an exhibition called the Founder’s Memorial that aims to commemorate the values and ideals exemplified by the late Founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore’s first-generation leaders, as well as other key personalities who played important roles in Singapore’s path to independence. This exhibition is slated to open in 2027 at Bay East Garden where it is envisioned to be an integrated gallery and gardens experience commemorating how independent Singapore came to be, and inspire Singaporeans to commit themselves to building the nation’s future, together.

In the 2022 edition of this exhibition, the NHB has called for schools to participate in the Student Archivist Project that will run from January to April 2022. Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) has nominated two teams of two students to collect personal stories from senior interviewees about how they were involved in key policies and developments in Singapore’s public health and medicine sector between the 1950s and 1970s, and their reflections on the values demonstrated in those times. Our students were trained in oral history interview methodology before they plan and conduct their own oral history interviews with senior interviewees aged 60 and above. Through this process, our students deepened their understanding about the experiences and contributions of individuals who played important roles in Singapore’s development post-independence.

**3. MOE History Challenge**

The MOE History Challenge aims to engage students in the disciplinary aspects of History where they can demonstrate their knowledge of the subject and apply conceptual understanding across different historical periods.

Students who perform well in the History Challenge will be invited to join the History Talent Development Programme (HTDP), which aims to develop students’ interest in History and deepen their understanding of the discipline. Through their participation in the HTDP, students will be given opportunities to engage with history experts on a range of historical issues.

In 2021, 4 of our Secondary 3 students participated in this online Challenge which was conducted via the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) due to the COVID-19 situation. Out of 440 students from 110 schools, we are proud to announce that Lee Choon Yee of J3-3 was shortlisted for the History Talent Development Programme (HTDP)! Congratulations Choon Yee!

#### Humanities Department Enrichment Programme
The Humanities Department also offer enrichment programme to help our students gain deeper appreciation of the Humanities and its relevance to Singapore and the world.


**1. GEM Challenge ASEAN**

**Objective**

The aim of the ASEAN internationalisation Programme (AIP) is for students to better understand globalisation and its impact on economy, society and culture. With the changing trends from the global pandemic and climate change, students are exposed to these issues through differing perspective.

**Programme**

The AIP to Thailand provided the students with the opportunity to engage in meaningful activities to learn more about Thailand through virtual school exchange and online lessons to learn more about the Thai language

To help students better understand how local companies stay competitive in a globalising world, &nbsp;Ya Kun Kaya Toast was invited to share via zoom with our students on how they have ventured abroad to set up branches in Thailand and other countries To understand how companies adopt sustainable practices, a speaker from the Elephant Poopoopaper Park in Thailand was invited to share on the sustainability approaches they have adopted in their business operations to leave a smaller footprint for future generations.

This exchange allowed our students to foster empathy, resilience and humility as they interact with the locals and appreciate a world outside of Singapore.

**2. GEMS Challenge – Model United Nations (MUN)**

To foster critical thinking and hone research and writing skills, the Humanities department offers the Model United Nations (MUN) GEMS Challenge to selected Secondary 3 students. Through participating in various MUNs, students gained a better understanding of global issues and insights on the mechanisms of international relations. They also learn to sharpen their public speaking and debating skills during these academic simulations.

Our GEMS participated in the Singapore Model Cabinet (SMC), organised by the People’s Association (PA) and Victoria Junior College (VJC). Our GEMS adopted the role of Singapore policymakers and discussed how Singapore can tackle various issues, given our constraints and differing needs.

Our GEMS also participated in the Raffles Model United Nation (RMUN), conducted by Raffles Institution. Through RMUN, our GEMS worked with other students to analyse current societal issues that have global significance and discussed on how countries could manage them.

#### Social Studies
**Overview**

Social Studies is compulsory for all Express and Normal (Academic) students at the Upper Secondary level. Together with either Geography (Elective), History (Elective) or Literature (Elective), they make up the subject commonly known as Humanities.

In GMS(S), the Social Studies curriculum seeks to prepare our GEMS to be citizens of tomorrow by helping them to understand the inter-connectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and to appreciate the complexities of the human experience. More importantly, we want to build up our GEMS and develop them to become concerned citizens who proactively extend their service beyond the school to the community for the betterment of society.

The Department’s approach is firmly based on the Critical Inquiry approach. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, our GEMS attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues concerning Singapore and the world; develop critical and reflective thinking skills; and suggest solutions to the myriad of issues facing our society.

**Issue Investigation**

The Secondary 3 Issue Investigation (II) project is a critical part of the Social Studies curriculum. It forms an important component of our GEMS Continual Assessment. In II, our GEMS work to identify and research on societal needs in Singapore. Our GEMS also research and suggest ways to mitigate these issues.

To align to the Singapore Smart Nation vision, students were taught how to create a website to feature their II research, data collection and suggestions to appeal to their target audiences.

The following are screenshots of some artistically designed II websites from the 2022 cohort.

1.  **Speaker Series’ Programme**

The Speaker Series’ programme is a series of talks organised by the GMS(S) Humanities Department, where speakers from various segments of society are invited to share with Secondary 3 students about different societal concerns in Singapore. The goal of the Speaker Series’ program is help students better understand and appreciate how the concepts and issues in the Upper Secondary Social Studies syllabus relate to real life, the roles played by the different stakeholders, and how individuals like themselves can play a part in contributing to society.

We had the privilege of having Ms Fatima from the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) to share the challenges faced by migrant workers in Singapore, and the various ways in which MWC support them. She also shared how students could make a difference by being more gracious to migrant workers..

We had the honour of inviting Mr Russ Neu, the CEO of Social Collider, an aggregator of resources for social enterprises in Singapore, to share with us about food security in Singapore. The students learned about the food security challenges faced by Singapore, and the measures taken to overcome such challenges, such as the 30 by 30 plan (which aims to build up Singapore's capacity to produce 30% of our food locally and sustainably by 2030).

**2.Internal Security Department (ISD) Mobile Exhibition**

Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) hosted the ISD mobile exhibition in July 2022 to help our students better understand terrorism: its impact on Singapore, as well as the measures we can take to protect our country from these threats.. As part of the Home Team (under Ministry of Home Affairs, MHA), the Internal Security Department (ISD) confronts and addresses Singapore’s security issues and threats to keep Singapore safe and sovereign. Over the years, ISD and its predecessor, Special Branch, have dealt with many threats to Singapore’s internal stability, security and sovereignty.

The exhibition also included a section on SG Secure which is a movement to build the resilience of our community and a call to action to everyone in our multi-racial, multi-religious society to come together to safeguard Singapore and our way of life. As part of national education efforts, this exhibition reminds students to always stay vigilant as harmony does not come easy.
