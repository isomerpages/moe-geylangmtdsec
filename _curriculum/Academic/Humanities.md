**Humanities Inquiry-based Learning as Key Pedagogy**

At GMS(S), the Humanities Department takes the lead in adopting the Humanities Inquiry Approach. It refers to the common understanding of how inquiry-based learning can take place in the Humanities subjects of Geography, History, and Social Studies.

Inquiry is a purposeful act of seeking information or knowledge, activating prior knowledge, investigating significant questions, and constructing knowledge. As it promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their own learning, it ties in aptly with our schoolâ€™s vision to develop our students into passionate learners. It facilitates an engaged, deepened thinking process in the learner about the issues under study and what these issues mean to them. It also grows the learner into a self-reflective inquirer who thinks about his/her thinking. We want all our GEMS to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.
