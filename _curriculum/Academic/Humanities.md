**Humanities Inquiry-based Learning as Key Pedagogy**

At GMS(S), the Humanities Department takes the lead in adopting the Humanities Inquiry Approach. It refers to the common understanding of how inquiry-based learning can take place in the Humanities subjects of Geography, History, and Social Studies.

Inquiry is a purposeful act of seeking information or knowledge, activating prior knowledge, investigating significant questions, and constructing knowledge. As it promotes student-centred learning by creating opportunities for students to take ownership of their own learning, it ties in aptly with our school’s vision to develop our students into passionate learners. It facilitates an engaged, deepened thinking process in the learner about the issues under study and what these issues mean to them. It also grows the learner into a self-reflective inquirer who thinks about his/her thinking. We want all our GEMS to become Passionate Learners, Courageous Leaders, Caring Citizens.

			<p>The 3D Design Challenge is one of the school’s GEMS Challenge offered to our Secondary 3 students. In this Challenge, students learn how to use CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software to design a product and are taught how to use Autodesk Inventor to design a solution from their identified needs. Students will experience the process of 3D printing as their completed designs will be printed using the 3D-printing technology.<br><br>The students also have the opportunity to visit the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where they will be exposed to the courses offered in the higher learning institute.</p>

			<p>This is the ninth year that we have taken part in the Nanyang Polytechnic Science and Technology Challenge. Our students get to apply what they have learnt in D&T lessons in the challenges they have signed up for. At the same time, they also learn new skills and knowledge while attending the workshop prior to the challenge.<br><br>One of the most rewarding moments for our students was when their designs were recognised and awarded during the competition.</p>
