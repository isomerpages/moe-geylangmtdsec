From a list of 15 specially selected titles, the students have the opportunity to choose a book title and purchase it for their personal reading. They are encouraged to read the book during assembly or at their own time to develop a habit of reading.

		<p><h3>EL Programmes to Develop Effective Communicators</h3></p>
		<p>The <b>Speak Good English Movement (SGEM)</b> aims to encourage students to speak English more fluently and instill a love of reading amongst students of all levels. It is also a platform for students to practise public speaking and develop their self-confidence. Every week, one to three representatives from each class make a presentation to the whole school. The presentation could be a response to an article they have read or on any topic of their interest.<br><br>Since Term 3 of 2020, our SGEM has gone digital due to the ongoing pandemic. This new platform of delivery has not only given students the opportunity to hone their communication skills but also their IT skills.<br><br>We hope students will find reading and speaking English fun through this programme!

	<p>Our Choral Reading Programme aims to encourage students to articulate well through choral reading, and to develop in students public speaking skills. Students choose their favourite texts that reflect their experiences to read aloud in unison with their group mates. As this unique approach increases their level of engagement, the programme also helps students build their fluency and self-confidence.</p>
