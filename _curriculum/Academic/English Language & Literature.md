<h3>English Language</h3>
<p>Language is a vehicle for communication and expression, and students are
equipped with the essential skills to communicate effectively in English.
It is precisely with this aim in mind that the English Language instructional
programme provides many opportunities for students to use English in a
variety of situations and contexts.</p>
<p>Using a wide range of materials other than the textbook, students learn
to listen, read, view, write and speak with understanding, accuracy and
critical appreciation. Through oral and writing activities such as debates,
role-play, advertisements, and reports, students learn to speak, write
and make presentations in standard English that is grammatical, fluent
and appropriate for purpose, audience, context and culture.</p>
<p>Our mission is to provide opportunities for students to become</p>
<p>√&nbsp;&nbsp; Proficient writers</p>
<p>√&nbsp;&nbsp; Confident communicators</p>
<p>√&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical thinkers</p>
<h5><strong>English Reading Programme</strong></h5>

the students.&nbsp; Regular reading underpins mastery of a language. We

provide a conducive environment to nurture the reading habit.</p>

<h5>Magazines Subscription</h5>
<p>To boost the language and critical thinking skills of students, the English
Department has curated a range of educational magazines (namely iThink,
Inspire or “I”) for students to subscribe to. These magazines complement
the English curriculum and at the same time, extend students’ general knowledge.</p>

<h5><strong>EL Programmes to Develop Effective Communicators</strong></h5>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Speak Good English Movement (SGEM)</strong>&nbsp;aims
to encourage students to speak English more fluently and instill a love
of reading amongst students of all levels. It is also a platform for students
to practise public speaking and develop their self-confidence. Every week,
selected representatives from each class make a presentation to the whole
school. The presentation could be a response to an article they have read
or on any topic of their interest.</p>
<p>Our SGEM has also evolved with pandemic. With the earlier safe management
measures, presentation was done digitally, via video, to the school. This
new platform of delivery not only gave students the opportunity to hone
their communication skills but also their IT skills. With the easing of
safe management measures, our SGEM has now taken on a hybrid presentation
form, providing opportunities for students to showcase their unique strengths.</p>
<p>We hope students will find reading and speaking English fun through this
programme!</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<strong>Choral Reading Programme</strong>&nbsp;aims to encourage
students to articulate well through choral reading, and to develop in students
public speaking skills. Students choose their favourite texts that reflect
their experiences to read aloud in unison with their group mates. As this
unique approach increases their level of engagement, the programme also
helps students build their fluency and self-confidence.</p>

<h3>Literature</h3>
<p>A critical eye is essential in this time and age, and Literature trains
students to have this!</p>
<p>Students learn to interpret and engage with literary texts. Through drama,
teachers create a positive classroom environment where literary texts are
discussed; and provide opportunities for students to develop individual
viewpoints and perspectives to various literary texts. Students learn how
to present their ideas clearly through constructive reasoning. The Literature
programme also equips students with the ability to respond to others’ views
on texts, including their peers’ and teachers’, and refine their own views
in light of different perspectives. Through the exposure to a wide range
of literary texts across prose, poetry and drama, the department aims to
develop students into sensitive and confident people with a sensible and
mature view of the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Literature Enrichment Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Every year, the Literature students participate in a series of workshops
to enrich their learning. The workshops cover the range of examinable texts,
as well as the common areas of learning Literature, like&nbsp;<em>The Unseen</em>.
Leading the workshops are lecturers from NIE, who are able to provide invaluable
insight into the subject that enhances students’ appreciation and mastery
of Literature. The students also gain the valuable opportunity to connect
and converse with students from other schools to broaden their perspectives
and sharpen their critical thinking skills. Invariably, our GEMs benefit
from these enriching experiences, not just for Literature, but holistically
as well.</p>
