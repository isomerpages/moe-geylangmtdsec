			<p>Language is a vehicle for communication and expression, and students are equipped with the essential skills to communicate effectively in English. It is precisely with this aim in mind that the English Language instructional programme provides many opportunities for students to use English in a variety of situations and contexts.<br><br>Using a wide range of materials other than the textbook, students learn to listen, read, view, write and speak with understanding, accuracy and critical appreciation.
