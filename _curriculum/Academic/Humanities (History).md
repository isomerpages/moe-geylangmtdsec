<p><strong>LOWER SECONDARY HISTORY:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 students</strong> were involved in the Historical Investigation
(HI) project on the Contribution of migrants to Singapore from the 1800s
– 1940. Students examined historical sources and used inference skills
to learn about the ways in which migrants contributed to the development
and growth of Singapore into a bustling city port. Through this project,
students had the opportunity to learn and apply historical skills such
as source-handling skills and gain a deeper&nbsp;understanding and appreciation
of the life and contributions of early migrants in Singapore.</p>

<p>For the Secondary&nbsp;2 Historical Investigation (HI) project, students
examined historical sources and conducted research on the changes in the
living conditions of the people in Singapore after World War II. The objective
was to understand&nbsp;the historical concept of change and continuity
by examing what&nbsp;life was like before and after the Japanese Occupation.
They presented their inquiry in varied and creative ways such as a children’s
story book, a play, a diary, or a series of recreated historical correspondences
showing their understanding of the times.</p>
