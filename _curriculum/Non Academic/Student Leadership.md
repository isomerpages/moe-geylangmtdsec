Vision: Every GEM has the COURAGE and COMPETENCY to SERVE as they LEAD. 

“Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,” Philippians 2:3

GM Student Leadership Framework is inclusive and differentiated.

**Tier 1: Leadership Acquisition**

All Secondary 1 to S3 students will go through a progressive leadership training that aims to equip them with core leadership competencies and skills. This sets to build on the students’ competencies in Self Leadership.

**Tier 2: Leadership Experience**

Students will be provided with different leadership opportunities through the five leadership wings (Student Council, House Committee, CCA, Class Committee, GEMS Leaders). By taking on leadership appointments, students will further develop leadership competencies in Team Leadership.

**Tier 3: Leadership Synthesis**

At the pinnacle, we have the different executive committees which will lead the student population in their various leadership wings; and the GEMS Leaders who mentor and guide the incoming Secondary 1s each year.

Leadership trainings are tiered, with varying rigor and intensity, based on students’ readiness.

The design of our student leadership programme is guided by Kouzes and Posner's Model in Transformational Leadership which provides a breadth of practices to develop student leaders - challenging the process, inspiring a shared vision, enabling others to act, modeling the way, and encouraging the heart (Kouzes & Posner, 1995, 2002). Students will use the tiered behavioural statements linked to each practice to reflect on their personal leadership journey to grow as Courageous Leaders.
