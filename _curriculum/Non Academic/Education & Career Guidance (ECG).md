<h4><strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong></h4>
<p>The aim of ECG is to help students develop self-awareness to make informed
decisions about their education and career plans.</p>
<p>As part of their ECG experience in GMS(S), students will participate in
a wide range of programmes to explore their strengths, interests, and aspirations
in addition to the various education options and possible career pathways.
Students can also consult the ECG Counsellor for guidance individually
or in a group setting.</p>
