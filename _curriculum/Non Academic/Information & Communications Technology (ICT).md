The ICT Department harnesses technology to provide an enriching learning experience for all GEMS. We aim to promote a pervasive culture of using ICT effectively in the school curriculum to enhance pedagogy that engages collaboration and self-directed learning. In order to maximise learning moments, the following programmes are implemented:

**Digital Learning Roadmap envisioned for 2020 and beyond:**

| Levels of Service<br>(Domain) 	| Description 	| Programme 	| Target Audience 	| When 	| Theme 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Level I<br>“Discovering &amp; Building“ 	| Baseline ICT Skills to level up the cohort 	| 2x2hr elective programme<br><br>  	| Sec 1 classes 	| Term 1 	| Laying Strong Foundations 	|
|  	| Tier 1 – Introduction to coding 	| 2hr workshop conducted within the classroom 	|  	| Term 4<br><br>(Post exam programme) 	| Passionate Learners as per School vision. 	|
| Level II<br><br>“Curious &amp; Exploring” 	| Tier 2 – An advance module for those keen to explore coding with the aid of the Micro:Bit. 	| 3x3hr class within the computer lab 	| Sec 2  (max 40 students) 	| Term 2 (together with MADD) 	| Building a GM community of learners 	|
| Level III<br><br>“Enthusiastic &amp; Performing” 	| Keener students in the advanced class are spotted and trained. Further skills are honed at STEM competitions and hackathons 	| Inter-school competitions 	| Sec 2/3 students displaying good potential and interested to represent the school in external competitions 	| Semester 2 	| Building a GM community of learners<br><br>School values of Excellence and Mastery of skills 	|
| Level IV<br><br>“Passionate &amp; Soaring” 	| GEMS challenge. Students are introduced to advanced languages like Python. Students in this tier seek their own objectives and may want to enter external competitions. 	| GEMS Challenge<br><br>School provides support and link up with partners/entities to realise this vision. 	| Sec 3 GEMS Robotics Challenge 	| Whole year 	| School values of Excellence and Mastery of skill 	|

**IT Enrichment Programme**&nbsp;

With rapid advancements in technology and demand for 21st Century Competencies, the baseline ICT standards across all Singapore schools have seen continuous changes.&nbsp; In order to meet these required baseline ICT standards, all Lower Secondary students in GM undergo a compulsory IT Enrichment Programme.&nbsp; ITP is incorporated into curriculum time, allowing a seamless integration with other subjects.&nbsp; The strategic focus of ITP is to equip students with 21st Century Skills, with a strong emphasis on computing, digital fluency and core competencies.

*   **Baseline ICT Training**is taught in Secondary One to level up and develop the skills needed to accomplish tasks, which may be required of the students in subjects that require report writing; and research, data crunching and presentation skills.

*   **Micro:Bit Programming Tier I**&nbsp;is introduced to Secondary One students to initiate students into coding via the use of drag and drop input programming tools to elicit an appropriate output via the Micro:Bit, a sensor based microcontroller. Students create animations and simple games to explore the wonders of making their own thinking visible.

*   **Micro:Bit Programming Tier II**&nbsp;is an elective programme for our Secondary Two students&nbsp;in MADD Fiesta, an annual Secondary Two post-examination programme. In this Tier II programme, students can further enhance their computational thinking skills by creating controllable racing car models and programmable LED lighting systems with the Micro:Bit.

Students who show potential and talent are then recruited to participate in regional and inter-school competitions. They are also invited to showcase their learning at international symposiums on Educational Technology.

Through the use of technology, we hope to maximise every learning opportunity by being current, student-centred and future-thinking.
