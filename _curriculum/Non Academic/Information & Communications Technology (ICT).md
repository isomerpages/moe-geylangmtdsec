The ICT Department harnesses technology to provide an enriching learning experience for all GEMS. We aim to promote a pervasive culture of using ICT effectively in the school curriculum to enhance pedagogy that engages collaboration and self-directed learning. In order to maximise learning moments, the following programmes are implemented:
