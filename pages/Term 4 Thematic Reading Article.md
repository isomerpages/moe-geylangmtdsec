**Reflections of Our GM Alumni**

GM Alumni: Abraham Aw

Year of graduation from GMS(S): 2017

Recently graduated from TMJC, and have just enlisted

1.  **How did you juggle between studies and CCA?**

I was more involved in my external CCA (Taekwondo) during my secondary school days, something that I’m still doing now.

For me, Taekwondo is a sport that I am deeply passionate about and is an outlet to relieve my academic stress. The **sporadic** moments of ‘Zen’ in Taekwondo allowed me to better focus on my academic ventures. Of course, to do so, I had to allocate my time wisely and not procrastinate. Time allocation itself can be in the form of having timetables set to maximise your time, which **if adhered to** would give me greater freedom to pursue my sporting endeavours while getting my revision done.

To manage my **fatigue**, I take study breaks that are usually short naps to revitalise myself. I would advise not using your phones because they utilise your brains for the wrong reasons, worsening fatigue.

2.  **What challenges did you face in GMS(S)? How did you overcome them?**

I was not the best student at the beginning of my secondary school years. I wasn't fond of the school and I suppose that level of resentment translated to a lack of motivation to do my best. My grades suffered tremendously and I had to repeat Sec 1 and was laterally transferred from the Express to the Normal Academic (NA) stream. I suppose then the largest challenge was my pure lack of discipline, which affected not only my studies but also my conduct. I'm sure the teachers can **attest** that I was not the best student and was a regular resident of the reflection room, largely due to my late-coming. My legacy in GMS(S) would perhaps be that I was probably the student who spent the longest time in the school, clocking a total of six years.

Of course, you would think that the trouble I caused would lead teachers to steer clear of me or perhaps just give up. That did not happen here. I was blessed monumentally to have met various teachers and two principals over the years who saw the potential in me and refused to give up. I had had teachers giving me wake-up calls and even doing home visits just to get me to come to school in my earlier years. Some took time to see me for consultations despite their **hectic** schedule. Some even mentored me and gave me a larger sense of purpose and confidence that I could be better than what I was.

The old me was directionless and easily led astray; but the help and support from my teachers and peers steered me back to what I believe is closer to the straight and narrow. They **incorporated a level of grit and discipline** in me that I carry even after leaving the school and I am deeply indebted to them.

3.  **Relate your experience of working with classmates or schoolmates in group projects. What are some key learning points?**

I am certain that those who have worked in groups may more often than not, experience conflicts and disagreements that threaten their friendships. That is normal. Many factors make a group project flow smoothly or make a group better than the rest. I believe that amongst the many, two traits should be at the **forefront**.

Firstly, one needs to learn how to be able to take criticism. I am a firm believer that the **fundamental aspect of growth** is to take in inputs to better yourself. This applies to group projects. Your suggestion may not be perfect, it mostly never is. Having someone give you an opinion on how to fill in the gaps that you have overlooked would improve your project. What separates a good leader from one who is bad is the ability to accept and adapt to the team’s constructive feedback.

Secondly, I believe in **efficient delegation**. This is assuming that everyone does his or her work. We all possess different strengths and we should work towards utilising them well. For example, some people are better suited for certain tasks while some are better in their writing skills. To ensure that the end result is optimal, members should play to their strengths. Of course, that does not mean you do not help the other members when they face a problem or if they require your input. Afterall, teamwork makes the dream work.

4.  **How have the leadership roles and volunteerism in GMS(S) developed you?**

Throughout my secondary school years, I have had the opportunity to be exposed to various organisations as part of the class Values-In-Action (VIA) projects.

What stood out the most was the overseas service learning trip to Batam, Indonesia in Secondary Three. That was the first time I was away from the comforts of my own home to be in a foreign land to make a difference for the less fortunate. I saw little reason to do so at the beginning and from a self-centred standpoint, saw little to gain. However, at the end of the trip, I learned so much about myself and gained many new perspectives.

The trip involved the class going to an orphanage to help them paint some buildings; and to teach and interact with the children there. The end-goal was to go over and bless and impact them, which I believe we did as a class through our teaching and our games.

Having a first-hand account of what it was like beyond the borders of Singapore gave me a level of **introspection** that really made me feel thankful for what I have at home. In my **naïveté**, I thought that the simple, or perhaps even difficult, lives of the kids there gave them little reason to be happy. However, after the trip, I learnt that it is the idea of counting your blessings that ultimately grants you contentment. That trip was an eye-opener and a lesson I learnt from. It also taught me to be more open and a little bit more **sanguine**, rather than just dismiss a programme for being boring and mundane.

Awaiting University entry

1.  **How did you juggle between studies and CCA?**

I had a planner that I brought around everywhere I go. I would write down all the upcoming tests, exams, CCA activities etc. I also kept a checklist of what I planned to complete for that day. It certainly helped me better manage my time. During recess or extra breaks in between lessons, I would try to complete as much homework as possible so that I could relax after school.

2.  **What challenges did you face in GMS(S)? How did you overcome them?**

I guess getting out of my comfort zone was one of the challenges I faced. Transitioning from lower secondary to upper secondary was not much of an issue as most of my Lower Secondary classmates ended up in my Upper Secondary class. As a result, there was not much need for me to take the initiative to talk to new people. However, instead of hiding in my comfort zone, I participated in more activities, such as joining the House Committee and being an OGL. I initiated conversations and slowly learned to be more open-minded about socialising with new people.

Another challenge would be balancing the increasing workload while remaining positive. I am quite a pessimist and would often doubt my own **calibre**. I was actually pretty stressed out back then as I had to balance Drill Competition training in Girl’s Brigade (GB) and the numerous tests we had. I managed my stress through confiding in my friends and family. They made me realise that whatever I was worried about was miniscule. Looking back, the test results really did not matter. My friends and teachers also readily helped me in my studies, which I am very grateful for. It really helped boost my confidence as they helped me grasp the concepts better.

3.  **Relate your experience of working with classmates or schoolmates in group projects. What are some key learning points?**

Firstly, be the group leader or choose a group leader that can be trusted. I think it is very important to have a seamless and organised plan with a clear goal in mind in order to finish the project quickly and efficiently. Secondly, communication is really important. Although it is a very clichéd learning point, it is important to voice your opinion and also listen to other people’s ideas. Lastly, do not procrastinate and aim to start the project as soon as possible. It is important to be **judicious** and choose the option that allows you to finish the project as soon as possible so that you can focus on other things.

4.  **How have the leadership roles and volunteerism in GMS(S) developed you?**

Leadership roles improved my communication skills. After all, a leader is nothing without her team. As a leader, there are **ample** opportunities to develop my communication skills through group meetings. I also had to deliver instructions in my CCA and that reduced my fear of public speaking. I believe the leadership roles also inculcated in me a strong sense of responsibility and played a part in building a strong work ethic.

As for volunteerism, it definitely made me better appreciate the little moments in life as I was reminded of the value of time and simple joys. It taught me to have a wider view of society instead of remaining ignorant and living in my own world. No one can escape the **vicissitudes** of life. Volunteerism taught me to cherish the little moments here and there, as well as learn to be grateful and to always give back to the community.

Currently working a Teacher in GMSS

1.  **How did you juggle between studies and CCA?**

I was not a motivated learner because I was merely going through the motion of attending school as a teenager. It was only when I took up Biology in Secondary 3 that I saw the relevance of what I learnt to my life. I started focusing on my studies when my teachers began counting down to our ‘O’ Levels examination and the first thing I did was to plan my revision schedule according to the time I had left. Since I could not revise at home, I asked some of my classmates to study weekly at the Changi Airport, which was a quiet place with minimal distractions. I saw CCA and my time in the Prefectorial Board as opportunities to unwind and bond with my friends. Hence, I remained an active member of my CCA and Prefectorial Board throughout my time in GMS(S).

2.  **What challenges did you face in GMS(S)? How did you overcome them?**

One of the challenges I faced was friendship problems that resulted from the change in class (from Secondary 2 to Secondary 3) and the change in priorities among my friends. It was difficult to accept that some friendships had to end because we felt that we could no longer “click” with each other. In **retrospect**, I realise that not all friendships will see you through your entire life. Some will end early but all will teach you something valuable. I shared a lot with a GB officer who pointed me back to sound principles in the Bible. It was definitely not easy to work through friendship problems but having the guidance of a trusted adult helped me to brave through the seasons. It may be easier to run away from my problems but that does not solve anything.

3.  **Relate your experience of working with classmates or schoolmates in group projects. What are some key learning points?**

Working in a group is never easy because it involves reaching a common goal through a group of people who have different working styles and personalities. I learnt a lot of leadership principles and skills through GB and I tried to be a good team player and leader by putting what I’d learnt into practice such as taking turns to talk, being respectful in my interactions, and delegating the work. It was also important to me to produce work of good quality and I had to learn to trust my group mates to do their parts properly without having me to do the work for them. It took a lot of courage and tact to speak up to my group mates when I found that their work was not up to standard. This is definitely one of the important skills to master because there was even more project work in the polytechnic and university. There is no running away from difficulties!

4.  **How have the leadership roles and volunteerism in GMS(S) developed you?**

I am thankful that I was given leadership opportunities in school because these became platforms for me to **hone my skills**. I was intentional in putting what I learnt from leadership training and from the mistakes made because I wanted to be a better leader who’s a positive influence. I made mistakes along the way (e.g. being overbearing, doing everything myself) and I learned from these mistakes when I took time to reflect and listen to guidance from other leaders and mentors. It is definitely crucial to be humble and teachable because our pride can get in the way of learning, leading and serving.

One major mistake that left a huge impact in my life was thinking that I was a very seasoned leader when I graduated in Secondary 4. I quickly realised in the polytechnic that I still had a lot to learn when I faced difficulties as a group leader and my group members could not deliver according to my standard. In fact, even today, there is still much to learn as a servant!

I also did my first VIA in GMS(S) and it got me thinking about why we should serve others. As I have always been very independent and self-sufficient, the thought of helping others felt strange! It was through years of going through the compulsory VIA programmes that I realised that I can play my role in society by using my resources, such as my talents, time and money to help others. Today, I value the opportunities when I get to serve others because I can put what I have to good use.
