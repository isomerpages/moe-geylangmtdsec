**Activities of the School**
(A student's essay taken from "1955 Activities of the School Student Essay")


Beside \[sic\] the usual routine of school work there are activities which are of interest to the girls. The school believes in the wise saying: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” and has provided many forms of recreation such as games, excursions and functions like our annual bazaar and the annual concert. We have a Literary Society and Bible classes as well.

Games such as netball, badminton and table-tennis are great favourites among the girls. On Friday evenings girls usually come for games. At the present we are prevented from playing before five o’clock as there is the afternoon school in session. There are matches between the girls of various houses and the winning team carries the shield. This year there were matches for netball and table-tennis but not for badminton. We hope there will be a challenge shield for badminton too.

Sports Day this year was on Friday 22nd. It was a great success and the weather was fine. Mrs Archer gave away the prizes. Mitchell House won the Challenge Cup. Sports day is an annual occurrence and all the girls look forward to it.

To raise the school Building Fund a Bazaar is held every year. The Bazaar is usually held after the third term examination. On this day the handwork of the girls are displayed for sale. Food stalls are set up and there are games for children. Parents, relatives and friends are invited and everyone including the girls enjoy themselves and forget for a moment their Trigonometry and Precis-writing.

The annual concert is very welcome to us girls. Before that day there would be practices and costume-making, painting of posters and selling of tickets. On that day the girls would show their acting abilities to their friends and parents. Last year we had a three-day concert and it was a great success.

Excursions are planned towards the end of the term. On 19th May the senior girls with five girls from Form IV paid a visit to the National Carbon factory at Bukit Timah. We returned happy with the knowledge that we had learnt something new. On 25th July, the girls of Form III and V made a trip to the dairy farm. We ended the day with a picnic at Telok Mata Ikan. Form IV and Form II had the same excursion on the 26th. Whenever there is time to spare, teachers try to plan excursions of educational interest.

The Literary Society is only two years old. Mrs. Abraham, our former Geography teacher laid its foundation. Once a week a meeting is held in the school hall on Friday. There is a general election at the beginning of each term when the various officers were elected. During the second term of 1955 we had an energetic President in Miss P. Ranjii. There were speeches, spelling contest and debates. There was also an Elocution Contest.

The Bible Class is a newly-formed group. It is held every Wednesday and attended by the girls of the school. Mrs. Berckman is the leader of this group. The girls have bible reading and discussions.
