**BACKGROUND READING- for all**

### In Helping Others, You Help Yourself

Consider the positive feelings you experienced the last time when you did something good for someone else. Perhaps it was the satisfaction of running an errand for your neighbor, or the sense of fulfillment from volunteering at a local organization, or the gratification from donating to a good cause. Or perhaps it was the simple joy of having helped out a friend. This “warm-glow” of pro-sociality is thought to be one of the drivers of generous behavior in humans. One reason behind the positive feelings associated with helping others is that being pro-social reinforces our sense of relatedness to others, thus helping us meet our most basic psychological needs.

Research has found many examples of how doing good, in ways big or small, not only _feels_ good, but also _does_ us good. For instance, the well-being-boosting and depression-lowering benefits of volunteering have been repeatedly documented. As has the sense of meaning and purpose that often accompanies altruistic behavior. Even when it comes to money, spending it on others predicts increases in happiness compared to spending it on ourselves. Moreover studies suggest a link between generosity and happiness in the brain. For example, donating money to charitable organisations activates the same (mesolimbic) regions of the brain that respond to monetary rewards or gifts. In fact, the mere intent and commitment to generosity can stimulate change and make people happier J

### READING 1: ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS (sec 1)

**Environmental Awareness**

Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the importance of its protection. Promoting environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental steward and participate in creating a brighter future for our children.

**What is Environmental Awareness?**

To define environmental awareness we must first understand the environmentalist movement. Environmentalism is an ideology that evokes the necessity and responsibility of humans to respect, protect, and preserve the natural world from its anthropogenic (caused by humans) afflictions.

Environmental awareness is an integral part of the movement’s success. By teaching our friends and family that the physical environment is fragile and indispensable, we can begin fixing the problems that threaten it.

**How to Promote Environmental Awareness**

Before you can begin promoting environmental awareness in your community, you must first make sure that you have a thorough understanding of environmental issues. Stay up to date on environmental news, read books and other resources, and learn about the issues affecting your own community. It’s much easier to talk to others about the environment if you’ve already taken the time to educate yourself.

Numerous resources are available to promote environmental awareness and education: group learning (inside or outside of the classroom), informational and inspirational seminars, online courses, books, articles, videos, and brochures are just a few of the tools that can get you involved in promoting the environment.

A good course of action that ensures your continued participation is to pick an environmental issue that strikes you as the most urgent. The amount of environmental issues seems limitless, and while they are all important, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Try choosing one issue to focus on at a time. You will soon see that all environmental issues are intertwined and will find your niche of interest.

**Examples of Environmental Issues**

Here are several cause-and-effect problems that harm our environment:

*   **Oil Drilling-**
This issue is one that causes a great deal of environmental destruction. Our dependence on fossil fuel is a global addiction that affects every aspect of the world. Oil spills and offshore drilling poison marine life, oil drilling (on land) suffocates the earth, and the combustion of fossil fuels add to the increased atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO₂), which in turns causes the progression of global warming and ocean acidification. This is a multifaceted issue and is a good cause to get involved with because it covers such a broad spectrum of issues.

*   **Deforestation-**
Millions of acres of forest are cut down for industrial benefit, such as large scale farming, oil mining, and the production of paper goods. Deforestation causes wildlife and biodiversity extinction because the loss of habitat threatens many species’ existence.

*   **Production of Plastic Goods-**
Currently our society creates a great deal of waste and much of that waste consists of plastic. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2010 alone 31 million tons of plastic waste was created. This waste ends up all over the globe in both land and water. A good example is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Not only is plastic waste an issue, but the production of plastic is also dependent on fossil fuel combustion. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 201,0 191 million barrels of liquid petroleum gases(LPG) and natural gas liquids (NGL) were used in the U.S. alone to produce plastic goods.

*   **Share Your Knowledge**

After you’ve chosen an issue and educated yourself, engage your community, family, and friends in a conversation about the issue’s urgency and importance.

By engaging your community in the conversation, you are not only promoting environmental awareness, but you may also find opportunities to participate in communal projects or to get involved in other related causes.

**Make a Difference**

Once you’re well versed in environmental issues, you can use that knowledge to start beneficial projects in your home and/or in your community.

**Possible Project Ideas**

*   Instead of driving to work or school, take the bus, carpool, walk, or ride your bike to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.
*   Consider investing in appropriate technologylike clean power (solar or wind), if not for your home then maybe for a community centre. This supports a transition to clean and renewable energy.
*   Buy reusable products such as glass bottles, reusable bags and reusable cups. Avoid buying disposable goods such as paper towels, plastic bottles, and plastic bags.
*   Start composting and recycling, which will help cut down our waste production.

Once you have chosen your cause and have started a personal or community project, share it with the world! Get your coworkers, neighbors, friends, family, or even your local government involved. It’s much easier and more effective to spread environmental awareness and start a local project if you collaborate with others in your community.

Promoting environmental awareness is a crucial part of being an environmental steward. Start participating in the change and teach your community what is needed to create a sustainable future.
