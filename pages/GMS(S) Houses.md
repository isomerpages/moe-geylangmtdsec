From as early as the 50s, students and teachers in our School were assigned to four Houses. Annually, these Houses compete in activities and sports to win the House trophy. Our Houses are named after leaders from the Methodist Mission, whose presence was significant in the early days of the School.

**Archer House** is named after Mrs Edna Priscilla Caye Archer and her husband, Rev Dr Raymond Leroy Archer, who was the Bishop of the Methodist Church in Southeast Asia from 1950 to 1956.  Mrs Archer assisted in Methodist school events.

**Lau House** is named after Mrs E S Lau. Her husband, Rev Edward Sing Lau, was a well-known pastor of a few churches, including the English section of GCMC from 1930 to 1951.

**Means House** is named after Mrs Nathalie Means and her husband Rev Paul Means. The couple touched many lives in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and India as missionaries and educators. They were linguists who translated scriptures into Asian languages. This indirectly aided the preservation of indigenous languages in rural Malaysia.

**Mitchell** **House** is named after Miss Mabel Mitchell. She was posted as principal of GMGS from 1949 to 1950. Miss Mitchell helped the School attain grant-in-aid status and initiated a building campaign with the objective of making GMGS a full school with classes from Primary 1 to Secondary 4.
