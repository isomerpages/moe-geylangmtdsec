MethodistWalk21, a fund-raising effort administered by the Methodist Schoolsâ€™ Foundation, supports all Methodist Schools in Singapore. 100% of the funds raised by the school through MethodistWalk21 will be given back to the school that raised the funds.

For Geylang Methodist School (Secondary), the funds raised will be used to upgrade our school facilities and support needy students in our midst. Led by the PE Department, the staff and students completed more than 25 000 km of walk and run. We have targeted to raise a minimum of $60 000. Thus far we have raised $26 577
