1.  **As the former Chair of the BOM, what was your aspiration for the direction of GM?**

To provide a holistic education, nurturing our pupils not only in the acquisition of knowledge but more importantly to learn life lessons that are steeped in values. These children will grow up to become useful and responsible citizens and take their place as valuable members of society. They will develop a wholesome respect for God, friends and community.

2.  **You were involved in the rebuilding of the school under PRIME, both in the infrastructure work as well as the fundraising. Were there any challenges that the school faced? If so, how were they overcome?**

 I never saw fundraising for the school’s infrastructure as any problem at all. God owns the cattle on a thousand hills, the wealth in every mine. He always provides abundantly. The challenges were to push the boundaries of possibility in the classrooms and other facilities for the enrichment of the students. It was also important to pay attention to the functionality as well as the aesthetics of our school buildings.

3.  **What were the significant milestones that occurred in the school during your time as Chair?**

 The special upgrading of facilities for both schools, especially the provision of the two chapels; and the realisation that so many of our pupils were inspired to take up the teaching profession in order to give back to the future generations.
