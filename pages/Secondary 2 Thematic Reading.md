### In Helping Others, You Help Yourself

Consider the positive feelings you experienced the last time when you did something good for someone else. Perhaps it was the satisfaction of running an errand for your neighbor, or the sense of fulfillment from volunteering at a local organization, or the gratification from donating to a good cause. Or perhaps it was the simple joy of having helped out a friend. This “warm-glow” of pro-sociality is thought to be one of the drivers of generous behavior in humans. One reason behind the positive feelings associated with helping others is that being pro-social reinforces our sense of relatedness to others, thus helping us meet our most basic psychological needs. Research has found many examples of how doing good, in ways big or small, not only _feels_ good, but also _does_ us good. For instance, the well-being-boosting and depression-lowering benefits of volunteering have been repeatedly documented. As has the sense of meaning and purpose that often accompanies altruistic behavior. Even when it comes to money, spending it on others predicts increases in happiness compared to spending it on ourselves. Moreover studies suggest a link between generosity and happiness in the brain. For example, donating money to charitable organisations activates the same (mesolimbic) regions of the brain that respond to monetary rewards or gifts. In fact, the mere intent and commitment to generosity can stimulate change and make people happier J

### READING 2: SINGAPORE’S AGEING POPULATION (Sec 2)

#### Singapore’s Silver Age 

Almost every day, Madam Ho Yee Mooi visits a senior activity centre in Kreta Ayer near Chinatown, where she can meet her friends, exercise and play games. Although she needs to rely on a walking stick to make the trip some days, the 97-year-old says it is important for her to leave the house and talk to other people.

“If I stayed at home alone and faced the four walls all day, I would be very unhappy and become unhealthy,” said the fiercely independent senior, who also makes it a point to take short walks on Sundays when the centre is closed.

This indomitable spirit dates from Madam Ho’s days as one of the Samsui women, who literally helped to build modern Singapore. Even today, she keeps her one-room flat, where she lives alone, spick and span, and sews her own clothes from cloth given to her by the centre.

Like Madam Ho, most of the 50 seniors who are regulars at the Kreta Ayer senior activity centre are self-sufficient and content to spend their time chatting with their friends and doting on their family, said the centre’s manager Florence Loh. Others who drop in more occasionally have jobs, including as cleaners and drinks assistants at hawker centres, and are eager to keep working while they are still healthy. But there are also elderly folk who are too weak to even walk to the centre, and need special care, Ms Loh added. The number of such ailing seniors has increased dramatically over the last few years.

Then there are those who have shut themselves in their homes and grapple with loneliness on their own. In the two blocks of rental flats near the centre, some seniors turn away volunteers who conduct home visits to see if they need help, said Ms Loh.

Singapore’s rapidly aging population means that by 2030, the nation will join 33 others as a “super-aged” country, where one in five people are aged 65 or older. This silvering trend will touch every aspect of Singapore’s society and economy, from its fiscal policies to its generational dynamics.

Around the world, the experiences of other maturing countries have already illuminated the path that lies ahead for Singapore. In Japan, where one in four citizens is aged 65 or older, the number of workers paying taxes has shrunk even as the state’s pension bill has steadily increased. With fewer working people to support a growing pool of seniors, the Japanese government has been saddled with the highest public debt relative to the size of its economy among industrialised economies.

Faced with growing calls on the pension purse, many countries have taken to delaying pension payments and raising the retirement age. This allows workers to remain employed for a longer time, contributing to economic growth and relying less on the state.

Singapore has taken steps to minimise such potential intergenerational stresses. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) system encourages self-reliance by making each individual responsible for his or her own retirement needs, rather than burdening future generations with ever-increasing taxes. The Government steps in to meaningfully supplement the retirement needs of lower-income Singaporeans.

While strong family ties and support continue to be a critical aspect of ensuring that older Singaporeans can retire comfortably, these policies take some of the strain of caring for the old off the shoulders of the young, helping to strengthen family and community bonds. Still, retirement adequacy will be an ongoing worry as living costs continue to rise. And Singapore will have a shorter time to come to terms with this problem than many other nations. To adapt successfully, Singapore must move swiftly to change societal mindsets and implement an eco-system of support for the elderly.

“The older workers have been doing projects for a long time, and they know how to do it efficiently. They can teach the younger workers how to avoid common mistakes, and I can always rely on them to complete the works on time and within budget.” — Mr Melvin Tan, managing director of engineering and construction company Cyclect

But amid the challenges of ageing lie some silver linings.  Singaporeans generally remain healthy in their early twilight years, and many continue to be active contributors to society and the economy. To tap on their expertise and experience, Singapore will raise its rehiring age from 65 to 67. With Singaporeans continuing to work and earn an income for a longer period of time, seniors are increasingly seen not only as dependents but also as consumers. The booming silver economy is another way Singapore can benefit from an ageing population.

Singapore can also learn from the already super-aged countries like Japan and Germany.  In Japan, some senior centres and childcare providers are pairing up to create institutions called yoro shisetsu, which translates to “facilities for children and the elderly”. The seniors say the time with the children makes them feel more energised and fulfilled, while the children are more likely to respect and care for the elderly.

With some ingenuity, the Singapore can turn the ageing population into a rising tide that lifts all boats.
