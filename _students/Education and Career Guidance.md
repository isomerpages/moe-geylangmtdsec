#### **Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

The aim of ECG is to help students develop self-awareness to make informed decisions about their education and career plans.

As part of their ECG experience in GMS(S), students will participate in a wide range of programmes to explore their strengths, interests, and aspirations in addition to the various education options and possible career pathways. Students can also consult the ECG Counsellor for guidance individually or in a group setting.

Students can look forward to

·       talks by representatives of educational institutions and organizations

·       learning journeys to various educational institutions and organizations

·       GEMS@Work to catch a glimpse of the working world

·       ECG fair & career exploration workshop

·       use of MySkillsFuture portal
