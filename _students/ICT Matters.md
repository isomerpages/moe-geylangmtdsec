Every student will be provisioned with the following ICT accounts:
* 1)MIMS / SWN Account
The MOE Identity Management System (MIMS) enables the student to use the laptops in school. The same account is also used to sign in to the WiFi network in school. The SSID for the wireless network is SWN@SSOE.
* Student Learning Space (SLS) Account - [https://learning.moe.edu.sg](https://learning.moe.edu.sg). The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively. With the SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. Teachers will also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning. Students are strongly encouraged to provide their email address in the profile to facilitate quick resetting of their password should he/she forget it.
* Student iCon
Student iCON is a suite of Google apps that helps to better support students in their learning and collaboration with others. It is required to log onto the Dashboard on every studentâ€™s Personal Learning Device (PLD). Once logged in, the PLD will be automatically synced with the GMS(S) school WiFi
