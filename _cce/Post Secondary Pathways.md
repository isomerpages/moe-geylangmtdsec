    <div>
			<p><b>Humanities Internationalisation Programme</b><br>This internationalisation trip aims to teach our student travellers an appreciation of the world outside Singapore as well as equip them with knowledge, understanding, and a chance to witness the process of globalisation first-hand. Students on this trip also learn the importance of Singapore’s collaboration with Vietnam and other members within the ASEAN community. Singapore’s partnership with Vietnam began in 2013 with a strong economic cooperation culminating in the formation of the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs).<br><br>The internationalisation trip also seeks to provide students with the opportunity to absorb the sights and sounds of modernisation as well as rural Vietnam; experience the lives of local Vietnamese by visiting organic farms, villages; and learn local culture and history by visiting the War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi tunnels and various other historical sites.<br><br>Through this, we hope to encourage our student travellers to respect the socio-economic and cultural differences and norms and become a global citizen ready for the 22nd century.<br><br>In 2020, the internationalisation trip was adapted into a virtual trip to Vietnam, due to restrictions as a result of Covid-19. In this virtual trip, students held Zoom sessions with local Vietnamese establishments, to learn the impact of Covid-19 on the people of Vietnam and their adaptability to socio-cultural changes. The focus was on the impact of Covid-19 on the Vietnamese economy, tourism as well as its impact on local student life and education.</p>

			<p><b>Humanities Internationalisation Thailand Trip</b><br>In adapting to the challenging Covid-19 situation to make our Humanities Internationalisation Trip the most interesting ever – a virtual ‘tour’ of Thailand was organised. Students held Zoom lessons with students of a Thai Secondary School, learnt how to cook Thai food, make traditional handicrafts, toured a factory and interviewed a Singaporean expatriate.</p>

			<p><b>School Event: Green Programme</b><br>Since 2015, NEA has been running a Food Waste Reduction Campaign (FWRC) to encourage Singaporeans to raise awareness, drive action and promote advocacy amongst consumers to reduce food waste. Singapore has set the target of producing 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030 – up from less than 10% today.<br><br>The Geography team has decided to embark on a school-wide initiative: to create awareness and understanding; to encourage mind-set change; and to encourage action on food waste reduction.<br><br>The graduating students embarked on spreading the message of reducing food wastage and solving possible food issues faced by Singapore through poster design.</p>
