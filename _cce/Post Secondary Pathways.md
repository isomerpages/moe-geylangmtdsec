			<p><b>Upper Secondary – Young Docents Programme</b><br>An opportunity for students to learn and appreciate Singapore’s National Heritage and History through their Upper Secondary seniors.

			<p><b>Secondary 1 Historical Investigation</b><br>2020 was a special year for Secondary 1 Historical Investigation (HI project). Home-based learning and the digitalisation of learning saw teachers bringing the HI project to students’ homes, in place of the normal learning journeys that are required in HI. Students could easily access Little India, Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Beach Road through pictures in a Google Drive folder. While the key elements of working together, selecting evidence and formulating inferences remain, the end products were adjusted and well-designed and informative online posters were produced.</p>

			<p><b>Secondary 1 Healthcare</b><br>2020 was the year when Covid-19 hogged the headlines. To help students see the historical connection of present pandemic to past pandemics, students embarked on a healthcare project to find out the state of healthcare conditions in early 19th century Singapore. Students had to gather data about hospitals, medical facilities and public health measures. They had to study one infectious disease and analyse how it was brought under control.</p>

    <label for="accordion6">Humanities Interntionalisation Trip</label>
    <div>
			<p><b>Humanities Internationalisation Programme</b><br>This internationalisation trip aims to teach our student travellers an appreciation of the world outside Singapore as well as equip them with knowledge, understanding, and a chance to witness the process of globalisation first-hand. Students on this trip also learn the importance of Singapore’s collaboration with Vietnam and other members within the ASEAN community. Singapore’s partnership with Vietnam began in 2013 with a strong economic cooperation culminating in the formation of the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIPs).<br><br>The internationalisation trip also seeks to provide students with the opportunity to absorb the sights and sounds of modernisation as well as rural Vietnam; experience the lives of local Vietnamese by visiting organic farms, villages; and learn local culture and history by visiting the War Remnants Museum, Cu Chi tunnels and various other historical sites.<br><br>Through this, we hope to encourage our student travellers to respect the socio-economic and cultural differences and norms and become a global citizen ready for the 22nd century.<br><br>In 2020, the internationalisation trip was adapted into a virtual trip to Vietnam, due to restrictions as a result of Covid-19. In this virtual trip, students held Zoom sessions with local Vietnamese establishments, to learn the impact of Covid-19 on the people of Vietnam and their adaptability to socio-cultural changes. The focus was on the impact of Covid-19 on the Vietnamese economy, tourism as well as its impact on local student life and education.</p>

			<p><b>Humanities Internationalisation Thailand Trip</b><br>In adapting to the challenging Covid-19 situation to make our Humanities Internationalisation Trip the most interesting ever – a virtual ‘tour’ of Thailand was organised. Students held Zoom lessons with students of a Thai Secondary School, learnt how to cook Thai food, make traditional handicrafts, toured a factory and interviewed a Singaporean expatriate.</p>
