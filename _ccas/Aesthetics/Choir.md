Choir remains the only Co-Curricular Activity to be suspended during this pandemic. We miss the friendship, the laughter, and especially coming together (physically) to sing and make music.

This project, in a way, is a culmination of our digital learning journey - from grappling with new apps and recording techniques to a new norm of singing into the computer screen. Still, it has brought us closer to our own voices and made us more resilient and disciplined.

We stand not only with all choirs but other performing art groups to keep the arts alive.

Please enjoy.
