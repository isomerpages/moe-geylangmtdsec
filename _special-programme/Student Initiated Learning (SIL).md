# **Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)**

**STUDENT-INITIATED LEARNING 2022**

**SECONDARY 1 & 2 STARS PROGRAMME**

**Why Student-Initiated Learning?**

Student-Initiated Learning on HBL days will provide dedicated time and space for students to explore their areas of interests by initiating learning activities on their own. Students will dedicate about **an hour** to discover, develop and deepen interests through self-directed learning and exploration.

**What does** **Student-Initiated Learning look like in** **Geylang Methodist School (Secondary)?**

In Geylang Methodist School (Secondary), we named our Student-Initiated Learning the STARS Programme.

Our Secondary 1 and 2 students will choose an interest in one area of the STARS and embark on a journey of self-discovery and development.

Sports and Wellness (E.g. Exercise, Health, Mental Health, Food)

Technology and Innovation (E.g. STEM, Coding, Robotics, Game Design)

Aesthetics (E.g. Music, Arts, Dance, Drama, Design, Language, Culinary)

Reading and Writing (E.g. Books, Novels, Poems, Plays, Educational Magazines, Journals)

Sustainable Living (E.g. Care for Environment and Nature, Recycling)

This is achieved through a structured process of discovering of interests and career choices with MySkillsFuture, followed by opportunities for self-directed exploration and learning to develop their areas of interests. Students will end the year with the opportunity to attend one of the STARS modules for Secondary 1 or MADD Fiesta (Music, Art, Dance and Drama) modules for Secondary 2, which is aligned to their area of interest. This will help them deepen their learning with the trainers who are experts in the various industries.

Semester 1: Individual Work

Semester 2: Individual/ Group Work

End-of-Year: Secondary 1 SHINE and Secondary 2 MADD Fiesta
