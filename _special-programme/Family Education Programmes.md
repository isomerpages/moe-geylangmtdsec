In GM, we believe that strong families build strong schools, and ultimately, a strong society. To ensure the holistic well-being of every child, the school partners parents and involve our students in family education programmes.

In 2019, our school received the Family Champion Award presented by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.

### FamChamps

**Objective**    
To promote the holistic message of Family and raise future Family champions.

**Programme**    
FamChamps is a values-driven programme for students.

Every year, selected Secondary 2 students participate in the FamChamps annual training camp where they engage in a wide variety of activities and experiences. These activities and workshops aim to deepen in students their understanding of how strong families can be built. The students are also involved in a street survey to discover the thoughts and beliefs of youths about family matters. On the final night, all FamChamps participants will invite their parents to a dinner to honour them.
