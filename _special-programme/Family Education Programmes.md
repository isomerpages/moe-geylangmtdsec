In GM, we believe that strong families build strong schools, and ultimately, a strong society. To ensure the holistic well-being of every child, the school partners parents and involve our students in family education programmes.

In 2019, our school received the Family Champion Award presented by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.

### FamChamps

**Objective**    
To promote the holistic message of Family and raise future Family champions.

**Programme**    
FamChamps is a values-driven programme for students.

Every year, selected Secondary 2 students participate in the FamChamps annual training camp where they engage in a wide variety of activities and experiences. These activities and workshops aim to deepen in students their understanding of how strong families can be built. The students are also involved in a street survey to discover the thoughts and beliefs of youths about family matters. On the final night, all FamChamps participants will invite their parents to a dinner to honour them.

### Fathers@GM

**Objectives**

*   To provide the platform for more active and deliberate engagement of fathers in the school environment
*   To promote father and child bonding through involvement in school-planned activities.

**Programme**    
The school targets to run two Fathers@GM activities each year where father and child pairs engage in meaningful activities to deepen bonds and build memories.

On 23 February 2019, nine father and child pairs took part in an obstacle course at Bedok Reservoir Forest Adventure.
