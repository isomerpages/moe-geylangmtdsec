<h1><b>GEMS Challenge</b></h1>

The Secondary 3 GEMS Challenge is a signature programme in GMS(S). In this programme, our Secondary 3 students will choose a challenge to embark on during the course of the year. These challenges stretch our students physically, cognitively and/or aesthetically. These challenges are also set in social contexts, which will develop students’ social awareness and interpersonal skills through their interactions with one another.

In 2020, there were a total of 13 challenges for our students to choose from, such as Trekking, Cycling, Model United Nations (MUN), Illustrated Journaling, Mother Tongue Immersion Programme, ASEAN Internationalisation Programme, F1 in Schools, Applied Learning Program in Science (ALP), 3D Design with Electronics, Math Studio, GEMS Entrepreneurship, Robotics Challenge and Values in Action (VIA) service learning.

Every year, there are about seven training sessions for every challenge, each leading up to a finale. The finale may take the form of a project or a presentation of the students’ work.

    <div>
			<p><b>Objective</b><br>To provide students with opportunities to learn and use CAD (computer-aided design) software.</p>
			<p><b>Programme</b><br>Students in the programme are challenged to design an original idea and make it come to reality through 3D printing. They are guided by industry professionals through 10 sessions from January till May. Ideas from paper sketches are then translated to the CAD software before printing.<br><br>The students also have the opportunity to visit the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where they will be exposed to the courses offered in the higher learning institute.</p>

			<p><b>Programme</b><br>The ALPS Challenge, which is Tier 2 of the school’s Applied Learning Programme in Environmental Science and Sustainable Living, is designed for students who are passionate and interested in extending their scientific pursuits. The research-based and hands-on programme provides students with the opportunity to work with industry partners.<br><br>In 2019, the focus for the Secondary 3 ALP students was on water management (Semester 1) and food waste management (Semester 2). They had the privilege to learn from and work with our industry partner ECOSOFTT about rainwater harvesting. Our students also had the opportunity to build their own filtration system prototypes found in a rainwater harvesting system. To observe first-hand how a rainwater harvesting system is used in an industrial setting, they went on a guided site visit to CleanTech One.<br><br>In Semester 2, they worked with another industry partner, Lendlease, to embark on a food waste management project that aimed to reduce food waste not at the consumer’s end, but directly at the source (i.e. food vendors). To help them better understand the current food wastage situation in Singapore, they went on a field trip to Sustainable Singapore Gallery and had an exclusive back-of-house tour at Parkway Parade.</p>
