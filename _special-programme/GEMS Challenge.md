<h1><b>GEMS Challenge</b></h1>

The Secondary 3 GEMS Challenge is a signature programme in GMS(S). In this programme, our Secondary 3 students will choose a challenge to embark on during the course of the year. These challenges stretch our students physically, cognitively and/or aesthetically. These challenges are also set in social contexts, which will develop students’ social awareness and interpersonal skills through their interactions with one another.

In 2020, there were a total of 13 challenges for our students to choose from, such as Trekking, Cycling, Model United Nations (MUN), Illustrated Journaling, Mother Tongue Immersion Programme, ASEAN Internationalisation Programme, F1 in Schools, Applied Learning Program in Science (ALP), 3D Design with Electronics, Math Studio, GEMS Entrepreneurship, Robotics Challenge and Values in Action (VIA) service learning.

Every year, there are about seven training sessions for every challenge, each leading up to a finale. The finale may take the form of a project or a presentation of the students’ work.

They had the privilege to learn from and work with our industry partner ECOSOFTT about rainwater harvesting. Our students also had the opportunity to build their own filtration system prototypes found in a rainwater harvesting system. To observe first-hand how a rainwater harvesting system is used in an industrial setting, they went on a guided site visit to CleanTech One.<br><br>In Semester 2, they worked with another industry partner, Lendlease, to embark on a food waste management project that aimed to reduce food waste not at the consumer’s end, but directly at the source (i.e. food vendors). To help them better understand the current food wastage situation in Singapore, they went on a field trip to Sustainable Singapore Gallery and had an exclusive back-of-house tour at Parkway Parade.</p>
