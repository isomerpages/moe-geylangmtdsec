			<p><b>GEAR-UP</b><br>Our GEAR-UP programmes aim to bring our students with higher needs on a journey of self-discovery and seek to help them develop competence in areas of <b>A</b>cademics and <b>C</b>haracter through various learning <b>E</b>xperiences (ACE), and in the building of relationships. This is anchored on the Self-Determination theory of autonomy, relatedness and competence, and aligns with our school’s mission of connecting, nurturing and inspiring.</p>
			<p><b>After-School Engagement Programme</b><br>One of the key activities in GEAR-UP is our After-School Engagement Programme. We have partnered with Harvest Care Centre since 2018 and they have since invested time and effort to build positive relationships with our students. Their volunteers engage our students every Monday through a broad range of experiences that seeks to provide platforms for our students to develop interests, skills, habits and attitudes to navigate their lives. Activities include basketball, guitar, cajon, dance and study sessions. This year, our volunteers also connected with some of our students through online sessions during the 2 weeks of HBL and the holidays. Our students in guitar and cajon performed for Teachers’ Day in Semester 2.</p>
			<p><b>Begin with ACE</b><br>The programme aims to help our 1 N(T) students start it right with the learning and practice of study skills and SEL competencies. Students will connect with significant adults who will journey with them throughout the year as they learn and grow.</p>
			<p><b>ACE through NYAA Bronze</b><br>The programme aims to meaningfully and purposefully engage our 2 N(T) students and seeks to help them to be reflective and develop leadership skills through achieving NYAA’s objectives of Healthy Living, Outdoor Appreciation and Service Learning.</p>
						<p><b>Rise with Resilience</b><br>The programme is an academic coaching and resilience building programme that focuses on helping some of our graduating students Reframe Perspective (learn from failure), Reclaim Control (build responsibility and growth mindset), Regain Confidence (build self-esteem) and Request Support (build a supportive network).</p>
						<p><b>Mentoring</b><br>We work with our partners to befriend and mentor some of our students with the aim of connecting students with significant adults who will help them navigate through their teenage years.</p>
